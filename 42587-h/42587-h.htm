<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The object of this work is to give an account of the outward life of the
Franciscans. This might be fairly taken to include the whole activity of
the friars with the exception of their contribution to scholastic
philosophy; for that clearly forms a subject by itself. But even with this
limitation the account here given of the Franciscans’ work does not
pretend to be complete. The documents which remain to us do not by any
means cover the whole of the active life of the Franciscans. While for the
thirteenth century and the Dissolution the records are fairly numerous,
the materials for the intervening period are very scanty. Thus any attempt
at a chronological narrative was out of the question. And the almost total
absence of all Franciscan records (properly so called) in England, has
proved an effectual bar to any completeness of treatment at all. The
arrangement here adopted, both in the choice of subjects and in the
relative prominence given to each of them, is due simply to the exigencies
of the available materials relating to the Oxford Convent. The
topographical information derived from records and other sources has been
neither full enough nor accurate enough to enable me to supply a map or
plan of the property and buildings of the Grey Friars.</p>

<p>A few words will be necessary to explain the plan pursued in Part II. An
endeavour has been made to collect the names of all the Grey Friars who
lived in the Convent at Oxford or who studied in the University: the list,
if complete, would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> included all the names which were, or ought to
have been, entered in the ‘Buttery-books’ or ‘Admission-books’ of the
house. To show how far short of this aim the result falls, it is only
necessary to point out that the names of friars actually included in Part
II number little more than three hundred: and the connexion of some of
these with Oxford is doubtful. The bibliographies, appended to the
biographical notices, are intended to include all the extant works of each
friar, but not all the MSS. nor all the editions of each work.
Occasionally works are added which have not been identified, but of whose
previous existence there is sufficient evidence. For this part of the book
I have used, besides the well-known mediaeval bibliographies, a number of
catalogues of manuscripts; a list of these is given below, with the object
of showing not so much what has been done, as what has been left undone.</p>

<p>Among unpublished sources, the most valuable have been various collections
in the Public Record Office, especially the Patent, Close, and Liberate
Rolls; the Registers of Congregation (Reg. A a, G 6, H 7, I 8), the
records of the Chancellor’s Court (Acta Curiae Cancellarii <img src="images/reverse_d.jpg" alt="D" />,
<img src="images/reverse_f.jpg" alt="F" />, EEE, or <img src="images/reverse_b.jpg" alt="B" />),
and Brian Twyne’s collections, in the Oxford University Archives.
Further, I have had occasion to consult the Oxford City Archives, some of
the old registers of wills at Somerset House, and various manuscripts in
the British Museum, Lambeth Palace, and Gray’s Inn; the Bodleian and
several College libraries at Oxford; the University (or Public) Library
and several College libraries at Cambridge; the library of Sir Thomas
Phillipps at Thirlestaine House, Cheltenham; the National Library at
Paris, and the Municipal Library at Assisi. I have had no opportunity of
examining the episcopal registers of the diocese of Lincoln, extracts from
which, however, are contained in Twyne’s transcripts.</p>

<p>The Index, so far as it deals with the names of persons and places, will,
I hope, be found complete, with the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> limitations. The
authorities quoted, either in the text or in the notes, the places where
the manuscripts cited were written, or were formerly or are now kept, or
where the editions referred to were printed, are not mentioned in the
Index, unless there is some particular reason for including them. So far
as it deals with subjects, the Index is meant to be supplementary to the
Table of Contents. The writings of the friars are not classified in the
Index, except those which come under the headings <i>Aristotle</i>, <i>Bible</i>,
<i>Evangelical Poverty</i> and <i>Sentences</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, I wish to express my thanks to those who have given me aid,
namely, to the Rev. W. G. D. Fletcher, Vicar of St. Michael’s, Shrewsbury,
author of ‘The Black Friars in Oxford,’ who generously placed a valuable
collection of references at my disposal; to Mr. Falconer Madan for
assistance and advice; to the Keeper of the University Archives and the
Town Clerk of Oxford for allowing me free and repeated access to the
documents under their respective charges; and to the authorities in the
various offices and libraries in which I have worked, for their unfailing
courtesy.</p>

<p class="title">EARLY YEARS.</p>

<div class="note"><p class="hang">Arrival of the Franciscans at Oxford.&mdash;Their early Poverty, and
Cheerfulness.&mdash;Oxford Friars as Peacemakers, and Crusaders.&mdash;Relations
to the University, and to the first Colleges.&mdash;Their strict observance of the Rule.</p></div>


<p>The Franciscans first arrived in England in 1224<a name='fna_3' id='fna_3' href='#f_3'><small>[3]</small></a>. On Tuesday, the 10th
of September in that year (to follow the account of Friar Thomas
Eccleston, the earliest historian of the Order in this country),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> a
company of nine friars, four of them clerks and five laymen, landed at
Dover, under the leadership of Agnellus of Pisa, the first Provincial
Minister. After staying two days at Canterbury, four of them proceeded to
London; and at the end of the month, two of these, Friar Richard of
Ingeworth and Friar Richard of Devon, set out for Oxford. It is perhaps to
this place that the well-known story told by Bartholomew of Pisa properly
belongs<a name='fna_4' id='fna_4' href='#f_4'><small>[4]</small></a>. As they neared Oxford they were stopped by the floods, and
finding themselves at nightfall ‘in a vast wood which lies between Bath
and Oxford,’ they sought refuge ‘for the love of God’ at a grange
belonging to the monks of Abingdon, ‘lest they should perish from hunger
or the wild beasts in the forest.’ The prior, judging them to be
jesters<a name='fna_5' id='fna_5' href='#f_5'><small>[5]</small></a>, had them turned out; but a young monk, when the rest had
gone to bed, put them into a hayloft and brought them bread and beer. That
night he had a dream. The prior and his brethren were summoned before the
judgment-seat of Christ; and</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘there came a certain poor man, humble and despised, in the habit of
those poor friars, and he cried with a loud voice: “O most impartial
Judge, the blood of my brethren, which hath been shed this night,
crieth unto Thee. The guardians of this place have refused them meat
and lodging, although they have left all for Thy sake, and were now
coming here to seek those souls which Thou hast redeemed with Thy
blood; they would not, in fact, have refused as much to jesters and
mummers.”... Then the Judge commanded them to be hanged on the elm
that stood in that cloister.’</p></div>

<p>In the morning the young monk found his companions dead, and became an
early convert to the order of St. Francis.</p>

<p>On their arrival at Oxford, the two friars were received with great
kindness by the Dominicans.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘They ate in their refectory, and slept in their dormitory, like
conventuals for eight days<a name='fna_6' id='fna_6' href='#f_6'><small>[6]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>They then hired a house in the parish of St. Ebbe from Robert le
Mercer<a name='fna_7' id='fna_7' href='#f_7'><small>[7]</small></a>. Alms sufficient for the purpose were probably already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>forthcoming, as the new Order did not have to wait long for recognition.
Though they only occupied this house till the following summer<a name='fna_8' id='fna_8' href='#f_8'><small>[8]</small></a>, they
were there joined by ‘many honest bachelors and many eminent men’<a name='fna_9' id='fna_9' href='#f_9'><small>[9]</small></a>; and
it may have been owing to this increase in their numbers that they left
their first abode in 1225 and hired a house with ground attached from
Richard the Miller<a name='fna_10' id='fna_10' href='#f_10'><small>[10]</small></a>. It is significant of the rapid growth of opinion
in their favour that Richard</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘within a year conferred the land and house on the community of the
town for the use of the Friars Minors.’</p></div>

<p>Enthusiasm and self-sacrifice were the powerful agents which ensured
success and favour to the early Franciscans, and many are the stories of
their primitive poverty and its effects; and if the convent at Oxford was
not especially distinguished like that at Cambridge by ‘<i>paucilitas
pecuniae</i>,’ or like that at York by ‘<i>zelus paupertatis</i><a name='fna_11' id='fna_11' href='#f_11'><small>[11]</small></a>,’ the Oxford
Minorites, during the time of Agnellus at least, departed but little from
the ideal of their founder<a name='fna_12' id='fna_12' href='#f_12'><small>[12]</small></a>, and lived the life of the poor among whom
they ministered. The pangs of hunger were not unknown in the convent; and
on one occasion the friars were in debt to the amount of ten marks for
food<a name='fna_13' id='fna_13' href='#f_13'><small>[13]</small></a>. Their first houses were mean and small&mdash;too small for the
numbers who flocked to their Order<a name='fna_14' id='fna_14' href='#f_14'><small>[14]</small></a>; and the infirmary was</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘so low that the height of the walls did not much exceed the height of
a man<a name='fna_15' id='fna_15' href='#f_15'><small>[15]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>When at length they built their church, the brethren worked with their own
hands, and a bishop and an abbat who had assumed the coarse habit of the
friars are said to have ‘carried water and sand and stones for the
building of the place<a name='fna_16' id='fna_16' href='#f_16'><small>[16]</small></a>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>The appearance of the Minorites was no less humble than their buildings.
Their habits of coarse gray or brown cloth<a name='fna_17' id='fna_17' href='#f_17'><small>[17]</small></a>, tied round the waist with
a cord, often worn and patched, as Grostete loved to see them, hardly<a name='fna_18' id='fna_18' href='#f_18'><small>[18]</small></a>
distinguished them from ‘simple rustics<a name='fna_19' id='fna_19' href='#f_19'><small>[19]</small></a>.’ In the convent at Oxford,
pillows were forbidden, and the use of shoes was permitted only to the
infirm or old, and that by special licence<a name='fna_20' id='fna_20' href='#f_20'><small>[20]</small></a>. We hear of two of the
brethren returning from a chapter held at Oxford at Christmas time singing
as they</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘picked their way along the rugged path over the frozen mud and rigid
snow, whilst the blood lay in the track of their naked feet, without
their being conscious of it<a name='fna_21' id='fna_21' href='#f_21'><small>[21]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Even from the robbers and murderers who infested the woods near Oxford the
Barefoot Friars were safe<a name='fna_22' id='fna_22' href='#f_22'><small>[22]</small></a>.</p>

<p>‘Three things,’ said Friar Albert, Minister General, ‘tended to the
exaltation of the Order,&mdash;bare feet, coarse garments, and the rejecting of
money<a name='fna_23' id='fna_23' href='#f_23'><small>[23]</small></a>’; and the Oxford Franciscans were as zealous in the last respect
as in the other two. The Archdeacon of Northampton sent a bag of money to
Friar Adam Marsh, and when the latter refused it, the messenger threw it
down in the cell and left it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Wherefore,’ writes Adam to the Archdeacon, ‘the bearer of these
presents has at the instance of the brethren taken the said money,
just as it was, sealed with your seal, to your lordship, to dispose of
according to your pleasure<a name='fna_24' id='fna_24' href='#f_24'><small>[24]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The evidence of the Public Records, containing scattered notices of grants
from the Crown, is striking on this point, and the poverty of these early
Franciscans can hardly be better illustrated than by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> means taken to
relieve it. During the long reign of Henry III, the Patent, Close, and
Liberate Rolls contain only three grants of money to the house of the
Minorites at Oxford, and all of them are due to exceptional circumstances.
They are, ten marks for the support of a provincial chapter in 1238,
60<i>s.</i> for their houses in 1245 in lieu of six oaks which the king had
before given them, and three marks for the fabric of their church in
1246<a name='fna_25' id='fna_25' href='#f_25'><small>[25]</small></a>. The alms to the house at Oxford are almost wholly in kind, and
consist chiefly of supplies of firewood from the royal forests round
Oxford. The earliest recorded instance of royal bounty was a grant of
thirteen oaks in ‘Brehull’ (Brill) forest for fuel on the 9th Jan.
1231<a name='fna_26' id='fna_26' href='#f_26'><small>[26]</small></a>. A few years later they received fifteen cartloads of brushwood
from Shotover forest<a name='fna_27' id='fna_27' href='#f_27'><small>[27]</small></a>, and in 1237 fifteen oaks in Wychwood Forest ‘to
make charcoal<a name='fna_28' id='fna_28' href='#f_28'><small>[28]</small></a>.’ Similar notices occur almost every year&mdash;sometimes
twice a year&mdash;throughout the reign of Henry III<a name='fna_29' id='fna_29' href='#f_29'><small>[29]</small></a>. In 1240 the keepers
of the wines at Southampton were ordered to deliver one cask of Gascon
wine, of the king’s bounty, to the Friars Minors at Oxford ‘to celebrate
masses<a name='fna_30' id='fna_30' href='#f_30'><small>[30]</small></a>.’ In 1248 the Sheriff of Oxford received orders to</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘give to the Friars Minors of Oxford one cask of wine of the six casks
which he took into the king’s hand of the wine of those who lately
killed a clerk in the town of Oxford<a name='fna_31' id='fna_31' href='#f_31'><small>[31]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>But a fortnight later the king repented of his generosity and assigned the
same cask to one of his numerous relatives<a name='fna_32' id='fna_32' href='#f_32'><small>[32]</small></a>. Of more interest, as
showing that the friars were really classed with the poor of the town, is
a royal brief of the 12th of Dec. 1244 to the bailiffs of Oxford, bidding
them</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>‘give of the ferm of their town to Friar Roger, King’s Almoner, on
Wednesday the morrow of the feast of St. Lucy the Virgin, ten marks,
to feed a thousand paupers and the Friars Preachers and Minors of
Oxford, for the soul of the Lady Empress sister of the King, on the
day of her anniversary<a name='fna_33' id='fna_33' href='#f_33'><small>[33]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>With all their poverty and holiness they were singularly free from that
form of piety which consists in wearing a sad countenance and appearing
unto men to fast. We hear indeed of strict silence, of constant prayer, of
vigils that lasted the whole night<a name='fna_34' id='fna_34' href='#f_34'><small>[34]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Yet,’ continues Eccleston<a name='fna_35' id='fna_35' href='#f_35'><small>[35]</small></a>, ‘the brethren were so full of fun
among themselves, that a mute could hardly refrain from laughter at
the sight. So when the young friars of Oxford laughed too frequently,
it was enjoined on one that as often as he laughed he should be
punished. Now it happened that, when he had received no punishments in
one day, and yet could not restrain himself from laughing, he had a
vision one night, that the whole convent stood as usual in the choir,
and the friars were beginning to laugh as usual, and behold the
crucifix which stood at the door of the choir turned towards them as
though alive, and said: “They are the sons of Corah who in the hour of
chanting laugh and sleep.”... On hearing this dream, the friars were
frightened and behaved without very noticeable laughter<a name='fna_36' id='fna_36' href='#f_36'><small>[36]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Grostete said to a Friar Preacher, ‘Three things are necessary to temporal
health&mdash;to eat, sleep, and be merry<a name='fna_37' id='fna_37' href='#f_37'><small>[37]</small></a>.’ Excessive austerity was
discountenanced by the authorities of the Oxford convent. Friar Albert of
Pisa, who was himself ‘always cheerful and merry in the society of the
brethren<a name='fna_38' id='fna_38' href='#f_38'><small>[38]</small></a>,’ compelled Friar Eustace de Merc, contrary to custom, to eat
fish, saying that the Order lost many good persons through their
indiscretion<a name='fna_39' id='fna_39' href='#f_39'><small>[39]</small></a>. Grostete again</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘commanded a melancholy friar to drink a cup full of the best wine as
a penance, and when he had drunk it up, though most unwillingly, he
said to him, “Dear brother, if you often performed a penance like
that, you would have a better ordered conscience<a name='fna_40' id='fna_40' href='#f_40'><small>[40]</small></a>.”’</p></div>

<p>The friars lovingly treasured up the great bishop’s puns and jokes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
wise sayings<a name='fna_41' id='fna_41' href='#f_41'><small>[41]</small></a>, and were always ready to tell or appreciate a good
story. From first to last they had the reputation of being excellent
company<a name='fna_42' id='fna_42' href='#f_42'><small>[42]</small></a>, and were welcome at the tables of the rich or well-to-do<a name='fna_43' id='fna_43' href='#f_43'><small>[43]</small></a>.
They were allowed by the rule to</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘eat of all manner of meats which be set before them<a name='fna_44' id='fna_44' href='#f_44'><small>[44]</small></a>,’</p></div>

<p>a practice which occasionally caused some scandal<a name='fna_45' id='fna_45' href='#f_45'><small>[45]</small></a>; and Friar Albert of
Pisa ordered them to keep silence in the house of hosts, except among the
preachers and friars of other provinces<a name='fna_46' id='fna_46' href='#f_46'><small>[46]</small></a>. Like St. Francis himself, the
Oxford friars often possessed the courtesy and charm of manner which is
born of sympathy<a name='fna_47' id='fna_47' href='#f_47'><small>[47]</small></a>; and it was perhaps to this quality that their
employment as diplomatic agents is to be attributed. Thus Agnellus was
chosen in 1233 to negotiate with the rebellious Earl Marshall and try to
bring him back to his allegiance<a name='fna_48' id='fna_48' href='#f_48'><small>[48]</small></a>. Adam Marsh was on more than one
occasion sent beyond the sea as royal emissary<a name='fna_49' id='fna_49' href='#f_49'><small>[49]</small></a>, and Edward I sent
Oxford Minorites to treat for peace with his enemies<a name='fna_50' id='fna_50' href='#f_50'><small>[50]</small></a>. But to the
mediaeval mind, there was a cause more sacred than that of peace or good
government; and the Franciscans would not have had their great
influence&mdash;would not have become leaders of men throughout the world&mdash;had
they not shared the one ideal, which still even in the thirteenth century
appealed to every class in every country of Europe. The Crusades attracted
the scholastic philosopher no less than the baron with his sins to
expiate, or the serf with his liberty to win. It was partly to increase
his influence as a missionary<a name='fna_51' id='fna_51' href='#f_51'><small>[51]</small></a> that Adam of Oxford, one of the first
‘masters’ who joined the Order<a name='fna_52' id='fna_52' href='#f_52'><small>[52]</small></a>, took the vows of St. Francis;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> against
the wishes of his brethren in England, who hoped to keep among them so
famous and learned a convert, and who indeed feared lest he should come
under heretical influences<a name='fna_53' id='fna_53' href='#f_53'><small>[53]</small></a>, he went to Gregory IX, and at his own
prayer was sent by the Pope to preach to the Saracens<a name='fna_54' id='fna_54' href='#f_54'><small>[54]</small></a>. When Prince
Edward went to the Holy Land in 1270, he took with him as preacher Friar
William de Hedley, the lecturer and regent master of the Friars Minors at
Oxford<a name='fna_55' id='fna_55' href='#f_55'><small>[55]</small></a>. Hedley died before the army reached Acre; but these learned
friars did not flinch when summoned to meet a sterner fate. In 1289
Tripoli was captured by the Saracens: an English friar led the last charge
of the despairing Christians, carrying aloft the cross till his arms were
hewn off;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the above-mentioned friar,’ continues the chronicler, ‘who by his
example provoked very many to martyrdom, had been no small space of
time warden of the Oxford Convent<a name='fna_56' id='fna_56' href='#f_56'><small>[56]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The friars of both Orders soon took a leading part in the affairs of the
University. As Bishop of Lincoln<a name='fna_57' id='fna_57' href='#f_57'><small>[57]</small></a>, Grostete continued to exercise a
kind of paternal authority over the University<a name='fna_58' id='fna_58' href='#f_58'><small>[58]</small></a>, and his high character
and long connexion with Oxford gave him an influence which was denied to
his successors. It was natural that this influence should be reflected on
the Franciscans, whom he had taken under his especial care and among whom
was his ‘true friend and faithful counsellor<a name='fna_59' id='fna_59' href='#f_59'><small>[59]</small></a>’ Adam Marsh. The latter
was specially summoned to the congregation to hear and advise on the
answer sent by Grostete to some petitions of the University<a name='fna_60' id='fna_60' href='#f_60'><small>[60]</small></a>, and we
find him interceding with the Bishop on behalf of the Chancellor, Radulph
of Sempringham<a name='fna_61' id='fna_61' href='#f_61'><small>[61]</small></a>. One of the most important stages in the constitutional
development of the University is marked by the charter of Henry III in
1244, which constituted a special tribunal for the scholars, and formed
the basis of the Chancellor’s jurisdiction. On the 11th of May of the same
year, a deed of acknowledgment was executed at Reading and signed and
sealed on behalf of the University by the Prior of the Friars Preachers,
the Minister of the Friars Minors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> the Chancellor of the University, the
Archdeacons of Lincoln and Cornwall, and Friar Robert Bacon<a name='fna_62' id='fna_62' href='#f_62'><small>[62]</small></a>. Edward I
in 1275<a name='fna_63' id='fna_63' href='#f_63'><small>[63]</small></a> appointed ‘Friars John de Pecham and Oliver de Encourt’ royal
commissioners to decide a suit between Master Robert de Flemengvill<a name='fna_64' id='fna_64' href='#f_64'><small>[64]</small></a>
and a Jewess named Countess, the wife of Isaac Pulet, which had long been
pending in the Chancellor’s court; this however was not to be treated as a
precedent to the prejudice of the Chancellor’s jurisdiction.</p>

<p>It is probable that the example afforded by the houses of student friars
was not lost on the founders of the early colleges. We know that Walter de
Merton was a friend of Adam Marsh<a name='fna_65' id='fna_65' href='#f_65'><small>[65]</small></a>, and a benefactor of the friars, but
it would be dangerous to attempt to trace any direct Franciscan influence
in the statutes of his college<a name='fna_66' id='fna_66' href='#f_66'><small>[66]</small></a>. There is however no doubt about the
connexion of the Franciscans with the foundation of Balliol College. Sir
John de Balliol died in 1269 without having established his house for poor
scholars on a permanent footing. His widow Devorguila first gave them a
definite organisation in 1282. According to an old tradition<a name='fna_67' id='fna_67' href='#f_67'><small>[67]</small></a>, she was
induced to take this step by her Franciscan confessor, Friar Richard de
Slikeburne. It is clear that the latter was her most trusted and energetic
agent in carrying out the plan. Devorguila urges him by all means in his
power to promote the perpetuation of ‘our house of Balliol<a name='fna_68' id='fna_68' href='#f_68'><small>[68]</small></a>,’ and the
executors of Sir John de Balliol assigned certain moneys to the scholars
of the house</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘with the consent of Devorguila and at the advice of Friar Richard de
Slikeburne<a name='fna_69' id='fna_69' href='#f_69'><small>[69]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Nor was the connexion merely a transitory one. The statutes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> 1282<a name='fna_70' id='fna_70' href='#f_70'><small>[70]</small></a>
are addressed to Friar Hugh de Hertilpoll and Master William de Menyl, who
are evidently the two ‘proctors’ mentioned in the document. To the
proctors (who did not belong to the house but were in the position of
permanent visitors) was entrusted the institution of the principal after
his election by the scholars, together with a general supervision over the
economy of the college. They alone could expel a refractory scholar, and
they were constituted the special guardians of the poorer students<a name='fna_71' id='fna_71' href='#f_71'><small>[71]</small></a>.
Nothing remains to show how long the first proctors held their office, or
how their successors were appointed. It is probable however that the
office was intended to be a perpetual one<a name='fna_72' id='fna_72' href='#f_72'><small>[72]</small></a>&mdash;not a temporary expedient
to be called into existence from time to time,&mdash;and further that one of
the proctors was always a Franciscan. Two other documents bearing on the
subject are known to exist. In 1325 a doubt had arisen whether the members
of the college might study any science except the liberal arts; it was
declared to be unlawful to do so and contrary to the mind of the founder,
and was consequently forbidden</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘by Masters Robert of Leicester, of the Order of Friars Minors,
S.T.P., and Nicholas de Tyngewick, M.D. and S.T.B., then <i>Magistri
Extranei</i> of the said House<a name='fna_73' id='fna_73' href='#f_73'><small>[73]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The second document<a name='fna_74' id='fna_74' href='#f_74'><small>[74]</small></a> is a letter dated 1433 addressed to the Bishop of
London by</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Richard Roderham, S.T.P., and John Feckyngtone of the order of
Minorites in Oxford, Rectors of Balliol College.’</p></div>

<p>The Rectors having, ‘according to the exigency of the office which we
discharge upon the rule of the said college and the observance of the
statutes thereof,’ inquired into the working of the first statute,
decided, with the consent of the majority of the house, that it was
prejudicial to the college, and asked the Bishop to consent to the
modification of it<a name='fna_75' id='fna_75' href='#f_75'><small>[75]</small></a>.</p>

<p>It will be readily admitted that in the thirteenth century the Oxford
Franciscans deserved their high reputation. It is true, that frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
complaints are heard of the decline of the Order<a name='fna_76' id='fna_76' href='#f_76'><small>[76]</small></a>&mdash;that many
relaxations had been introduced into the Rule. But these were not demanded
by the English province. When Haymo was General, orders were issued by the
Chapter that friars should be elected in each province to note any points
in the Rule which seemed to require revision, and send them to the
Minister General. Eccleston<a name='fna_77' id='fna_77' href='#f_77'><small>[77]</small></a> gives the names of three friars elected
for this purpose in England&mdash;Adam Marsh, the foremost of the Oxford
friars; Peter of Tewkesbury, Custodian of Oxford; and Henry de Burford.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Having marked some articles, the said friars sent them to the
General, in a schedule without a seal, beseeching him, by the
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, to let the Rule stand, as it
was handed down by St. Francis, at the dictation of the Holy
Spirit<a name='fna_78' id='fna_78' href='#f_78'><small>[78]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>For about a hundred years from the date of their settlement in Oxford, the
Friars Minors were gradually acquiring property. We have seen that after a
short sojourn in the house of Robert le Mercer, the house of Richard le
Muliner became their first permanent abode. The position of the former
cannot be at all definitely ascertained; it was in the parish of St.
Ebbe’s<a name='fna_79' id='fna_79' href='#f_79'><small>[79]</small></a>, probably near the church and within the city walls<a name='fna_80' id='fna_80' href='#f_80'><small>[80]</small></a>. Wood
places it between the church and the Watergate. But he is certainly wrong
in the position he ascribes to the second house, namely,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘without the towne wall, and about a stone’s cast from their first
hired house<a name='fna_81' id='fna_81' href='#f_81'><small>[81]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>The house of Richard the Miller was undoubtedly between the wall and
Freren Street (Church Street). In 1244 Henry III allowed the friars to
throw down the wall of the town in order to ‘connect their new place with
the old one<a name='fna_82' id='fna_82' href='#f_82'><small>[82]</small></a>.’ Even apart from the fact that the Mercer’s house did not
at this time belong to them, it is obvious that the houses which they
acquired in 1224 and 1225 would not in 1244 be distinguished as the ‘old
place’ and the ‘new place’ respectively. The ‘new place’ refers to lands
which came into their possession about the time of this grant, and of
which Wood knew nothing, while the Miller’s house formed part of the ‘old
place.’</p>

<p>In fact, several years elapsed before the friars obtained property outside
the city wall, their first efforts being directed to secure the land
between the wall and Freren Street. It was not long before their cramped
area was enlarged. In the Mayoralty of John Pady<a name='fna_83' id='fna_83' href='#f_83'><small>[83]</small></a> the citizens of
Oxford subscribed<a name='fna_84' id='fna_84' href='#f_84'><small>[84]</small></a> forty-three marks sterling to buy from William, son
of Richard de Wileford, his house in St. Ebbe’s, with all its
appurtenances, ‘to house the Friars Minors for ever,’ the said good men of
Oxford giving to William one pound of cummin annually in lieu of all
service<a name='fna_85' id='fna_85' href='#f_85'><small>[85]</small></a>. The next grant of which we find mention seems also to have
been an act of municipal, rather than of private, charity. In 1236<a name='fna_86' id='fna_86' href='#f_86'><small>[86]</small></a>
Robert, son of Robert Oen, had given them a house adjoining their land, on
condition that he,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘having been a free tenant of the prior and brethren of St. John of
Jerusalem in England in the aforesaid place,’</p></div>

<p>should have the same privilege attaching to his new house in the parish of
St. Michael at the North Gate. This house of Robert Oen’s in St. Ebbe’s
was one of the ‘mural mansions,’ on the occupiers of which the duty of
repairing the city wall fell<a name='fna_87' id='fna_87' href='#f_87'><small>[87]</small></a>. The obligation, however, was now, when
the house came into the hands of the friars, willingly undertaken with the
King’s assent by the Mayor and good men of Oxford.</p>

<p>Under the ministry of Agnellus any tendency to accumulate property was
rigorously suppressed<a name='fna_88' id='fna_88' href='#f_88'><small>[88]</small></a>, nor does his successor Albert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> appear to have
been more lenient<a name='fna_89' id='fna_89' href='#f_89'><small>[89]</small></a>. But under Haymo of Faversham (1238-9) and William
of Nottingham (1239-51) a different spirit began to prevail, and one far
less in accordance with the original idea of the Order. Haymo</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘preferred that the friars should have ample areas and should
cultivate them, that they might have the fruits of the earth at home,
rather than beg them from others<a name='fna_90' id='fna_90' href='#f_90'><small>[90]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>And under William of Nottingham the Oxford house gained a large increase
of territory<a name='fna_91' id='fna_91' href='#f_91'><small>[91]</small></a>.</p>

<p>It was in 1245 that this took place, and a remarkably full series of
records relating to the event is still extant. By a deed dated 22nd
December, 1244<a name='fna_92' id='fna_92' href='#f_92'><small>[92]</small></a>, the King gave the Friars Minors permission,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘for the greater quiet and security of their habitation, to inclose
the street which extends under the wall of Oxford, from the gate which
is called Watergate<a name='fna_93' id='fna_93' href='#f_93'><small>[93]</small></a> in the parish of St. Ebbe, up to the postern
in the same wall towards the Castle; so that a crenellated wall like
the rest of the wall of the same town be made round the foresaid
dwelling, beginning from the west side of Watergate, and reaching
southwards as far as the bank of the Thames, and extending along the
bank westwards as far as the fee of the Abbat of Bec in the parish of
St. Bodhoc, and then turning again northwards till it joins the old
wall of the foresaid borough on the east side of the small postern;’</p></div>

<p>and they were further allowed to throw down the old wall which stretched
across their habitation. But in 1248<a name='fna_94' id='fna_94' href='#f_94'><small>[94]</small></a> this grant, as far as it related
to the wall, was cancelled; the old wall was to be repaired, and the
proposed new wall was not mentioned.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that in December, 1244, the friars did not
possess the land which they were then allowed to enclose; it is indeed
very doubtful whether they had any property south of the wall. Possibly
they may have acquired already the place which they held in 1278,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>‘of the gift of Agnes widow of Guydo<a name='fna_95' id='fna_95' href='#f_95'><small>[95]</small></a>, which the said Agnes had by
descent from her predecessors, and they pay thence to Walter Goldsmith
one pound of cummin<a name='fna_96' id='fna_96' href='#f_96'><small>[96]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The value was then unknown, nor is the position specified<a name='fna_97' id='fna_97' href='#f_97'><small>[97]</small></a>. It was,
however, no doubt situated in the suburb of St. Ebbe’s parish. Two other
plots of ground are mentioned in the same document as belonging to the
Friars: of one of these (that granted by Thomas Walonges) we have accurate
information, and shall mention it in its due place. Of the other nothing
further is known than that they held it by grant from Master Richard de
Mepham. But the grant was probably of later date than 1244. Richard was
Archdeacon of Oxford in 1263, became Dean of Lincoln in 1273, and probably
died in 1274 at the council of Lyons<a name='fna_98' id='fna_98' href='#f_98'><small>[98]</small></a>.</p>

<p>But the royal grant in the Patent Roll of 29 Henry III is explained by the
fact that the Franciscans, or rather their benefactors, were already
negotiating for the transfer of a large part of the property there
described, if not of the whole of it.</p>

<p>In February, 1245, Thomas Valeynes, or Valoignes (or Walonges as he is
called in the Inquisition of 6 &amp; 7 Edward I), carried into effect a plan
for the benefit of the Friars Minors which it must have taken long to
bring to a successful conclusion<a name='fna_99' id='fna_99' href='#f_99'><small>[99]</small></a>. It consisted in begging or buying
out a number of holders of property in the south-west ‘suburb of Oxford,’
and granting in one case at least tenements in another part of the town as
compensation. Thus, in exchange for two messuages with their appurtenances
on the south-west of the town, Symon son of Benedict and Leticia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> his
wife, received one messuage outside the North Gate, together with a
building then held by Hugh Marshall,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘which same messuage and building were formerly held by Benedictus le
Mercer father of the foresaid Symon.’</p></div>

<p>One messuage with appurtenances was acquired from John Costard and Margery
his wife, two from Warin of Dorchester and Juliana his wife, one from
William ‘le Barbeur’ and Alice his wife, one from Henry ‘le Teler’ and
Alice his wife, and a little later<a name='fna_100' id='fna_100' href='#f_100'><small>[100]</small></a> one curtilage ‘in the suburb of
Oxford in the parish of St. Budoc,’ from John Aylmer and Christiana his
wife. All these eight tenements Thomas de Valeynes, ‘at the petition’ of
the former owners, assigned</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘to the increase of the area in which the Friars Minors dwelling at
Oxford are lodged in pure and perpetual alms free and quit of all
secular service and exaction for ever;’</p></div>

<p>and we may reasonably conclude that they filled the space from the City
Wall on the north to Trill Mill Stream on the south, and from Littlegate
Street on the east to a line drawn from the ‘fee of the Abbat of Bec in
the parish of St. Bodhoc’s’ to the West Gate on the west<a name='fna_101' id='fna_101' href='#f_101'><small>[101]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, namely, on the 22nd of April, 1245<a name='fna_102' id='fna_102' href='#f_102'><small>[102]</small></a>, Henry III
gave the Friars, to enlarge their new area,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘our island in the Thames, which we have bought from Henry son of
Henry Simeon,’</p></div>

<p>with permission to make a bridge over the arm of the river dividing it
from their houses, and to enclose it with a wall, or in any other way
which would insure ‘the security of their houses and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>tranquillity of
their religion,’ On the same day<a name='fna_103' id='fna_103' href='#f_103'><small>[103]</small></a> the King ordered the Barons of the
Exchequer to deduct from the fine of sixty marks,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘imposed on Henry son of Henry Simeonis because he was implicated
in<a name='fna_104' id='fna_104' href='#f_104'><small>[104]</small></a> the murder of a scholar of Oxford, twenty-five marcs, for
twenty-five marcs which we owed to Henry Simeonis his father for an
island in the Thames at Oxford which we have bought from him, and
which said marcs he begged should be reckoned to his son in the
aforesaid fine.’</p></div>

<p>The next grant is dated the 27th of November, 1246<a name='fna_105' id='fna_105' href='#f_105'><small>[105]</small></a>. The King
announces that he has handed over to the friars, for the enlargement of
their premises, the whole messuage, with its appurtenances, which Laurence
Wych (or Wyth), Mayor of Oxford, committed to him for that purpose,
desiring them to enclose the same as they shall see fit:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘and the Sheriff of Oxfordshire was commanded to receive the messuage
in place of the King for the use of the said friars.’</p></div>

<p>It is quite uncertain where this land lay, and whether Wych granted it in
his public or private capacity.</p>

<p>For the next fifty years, excepting the undated grants of Richard Mepham
and Agnes widow of Guydo, which probably belong to this period, there is
no record of a gift of land to the Minorites. On the east they had already
reached the permanent limit of their property<a name='fna_106' id='fna_106' href='#f_106'><small>[106]</small></a>, and the Friars of the
Penitence of Jesus Christ settled about the year 1260 on the ground lying
to the west. This formed the parish of St. Budoc. In 1262<a name='fna_107' id='fna_107' href='#f_107'><small>[107]</small></a> the King
allowed these friars to build an oratory here; in 1265<a name='fna_108' id='fna_108' href='#f_108'><small>[108]</small></a> he granted
them, as patron, the church of St. Budoc (which adjoined their premises,
and which, owing to the removal or death of the parishioners, was too
impoverished to support one chaplain), ‘to make thence a chapel for
themselves.’ With the church they acquired<a name='fna_109' id='fna_109' href='#f_109'><small>[109]</small></a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the cemetery and the houses standing in the same and belonging to the
said church,’</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>with the proviso that the cemetery should always be treated as
consecrated<a name='fna_110' id='fna_110' href='#f_110'><small>[110]</small></a> ground. The value of the church was 20<i>s.</i> a year<a name='fna_111' id='fna_111' href='#f_111'><small>[111]</small></a>.</p>

<p>At the Council of Lyons in 1274 the Friars of the Penitence of Jesus
Christ, or ‘Friars of the Sack,’ were forbidden to admit new members<a name='fna_112' id='fna_112' href='#f_112'><small>[112]</small></a>,
and the Order came to an end when the old members died out. The Minorites
and their friends therefore applied themselves to secure the property. As
early as 1296 Boniface VIII wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln, ordering
him<a name='fna_113' id='fna_113' href='#f_113'><small>[113]</small></a> to allow the Friars Minors to take possession of the house or
area of the Friars of the Sack, whenever the five remaining brethren
should die or transfer themselves to other religious Orders. At the court
of Clement V, the first of the Avignon popes, the claims of the Minorites
were urged by John of Britanny, Earl of Richmond; and Clement issued a
Bull in their favour, dated the 27th of May, 1309 (<span class="smcaplc">VI</span> Kal. Jun. A<sup>o</sup>
<span class="smcaplc">IV</span>)<a name='fna_114' id='fna_114' href='#f_114'><small>[114]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘In a petition exhibited to us on your part,’ runs the document, ‘it
is contained that owing to the narrowness of your place at Oxford, you
and other friars, there flocking together to the University from
divers parts of the world in great multitude, do endure manifold wants
and various inconveniences. Since therefore the place of the Friars of
the Penitence of Jesus Christ of the same place of Oxford adjoining
your place, is shortly, as is believed, to be relinquished by the said
Friars, to remain at the disposal of the Apostolic Seat, according to
the tenor of the Constitution published by Pope Gregory X, our
predecessor, in the Council of Lyons, it is humbly prayed us, that we
deign to concede to you that place for the enlargement of your place
aforesaid.’</p></div>

<p>This prayer the Pope goes on to grant ‘of his special favour,’ mentioning
the earnest supplications of John of Britanny<a name='fna_115' id='fna_115' href='#f_115'><small>[115]</small></a> on behalf of the
friars.</p>

<p>The King, however, also had a claim to dispose of lands which his
grandfather had granted, and which, in default of heirs or successors,
legally escheated to the Crown. By Letters Patent dated the 28th of March,
1310<a name='fna_116' id='fna_116' href='#f_116'><small>[116]</small></a>, Edward II assigned to the Friars Minors the property which
Henry III had previously given to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> Penitentiary Friars, with the same
stipulation as to the cemetery. The land is accurately described; it was
contiguous to the place of the Friars Minors, in the suburb of Oxford,
twenty and a half perches long from north to south, six perches wide at
the south end, two and a half at the north, and four perches seven feet in
the middle.</p>

<p>Letters Patent of the same day<a name='fna_117' id='fna_117' href='#f_117'><small>[117]</small></a> confirmed the grant of four other
parcels of ground to the Friars Minors: some of these may have been
previously held by the Friars of the Sack. The ‘plot of ground in Oxford,’
five perches two feet from east to west, two perches and a half from north
to south, conferred on the Minorites by John Wyz and Emma his wife, may
have been within the walls, near the West Gate; the others were in the
suburb. Henry Tyeys gave land measuring six perches by five, and lying
between the site of St. Budoc’s Church and the Thames (Trill Mill Stream);
Richard le Lodere’s land, measuring fourteen and a half perches five feet,
by four perches and three feet, and stretching from the Thames to the
above-mentioned place of Henry Tyeys, was included in the grant, as was a
larger plot<a name='fna_118' id='fna_118' href='#f_118'><small>[118]</small></a>, measuring sixteen and a half perches from the Thames to
the ‘royal way,’ and ten perches in breadth; which seems to have included
the south part of Paradise Gardens<a name='fna_119' id='fna_119' href='#f_119'><small>[119]</small></a>.</p>

<p>All these places are described as adjoining the property of the Warden and
Friars Minors of Oxford.</p>

<p>It was probably at the instance of the Crown and as a protest against the
papal claims that the Minorites a few years later formally surrendered to
the King the area which had belonged to the Penitentiaries, ‘in its
entirety as it came into their hands,’ and received it back of the King’s
special favour in pure and perpetual alms<a name='fna_120' id='fna_120' href='#f_120'><small>[120]</small></a>.</p>

<p>One fragment of the Penitentiary Friars’ property came into the hands of
the Franciscans somewhat later. In October, 1319, an <i>Inquisitio ad quod
Damnum</i><a name='fna_121' id='fna_121' href='#f_121'><small>[121]</small></a> was held in Oxford to decide whether Richard Cary could,
without prejudice to the King or others, bestow on the Friars Minors a
place in the suburb of Oxford, adjacent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> their property, and measuring
five perches in length and five in breadth. The jurors declared that the
grant would not be injurious to the King or others, and that Cary
possessed sufficient property in the town to discharge all his civic
duties. The place ‘at the time when it was built’ was worth 20<i>s.</i> a year,
but now, owing to its ruinous condition, only 2<i>s.</i> Cary held it for a
rent of 8<i>s.</i> a year of Johanna, wife of Walter of Wycombe, Agatha her
sister, and John son of Alice, who was wife of Andrew Culvard, the heirs
of Henry Owayn; they held it of the Prior of Steventon, paying 4<i>d.</i> a
year in lieu of all services. The plot was therefore the fee of the Abbat
of Bec mentioned above, and is probably the same as</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the place which the Friars of the Penitence bought of Walter
Aurifaber, and they pay thence to the Prior of Steventon 2<i>s.</i><a name='fna_122' id='fna_122' href='#f_122'><small>[122]</small></a>’</p></div>

<p>A few months previously a similar inquisition<a name='fna_123' id='fna_123' href='#f_123'><small>[123]</small></a> was held at Oxford,
which resulted in an addition to the Minorite property on the east side
within the wall. This was a plot of ground of the annual value of 2<i>s.</i>,
five perches by six, granted to them by John Culvard. The town, however,
claimed the right,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘at all times when it shall be necessary, to have free entry and
egress thence to restore, repair and defend the wall of the said
town.’</p></div>

<p>In 1321<a name='fna_124' id='fna_124' href='#f_124'><small>[124]</small></a> Walter Morton obtained leave to grant in mortmain to the
Franciscans a place with its appurtenances, measuring five perches by
five, in the suburb of Oxford; and similar licence was given to John de
Grey de Retherfeld<a name='fna_125' id='fna_125' href='#f_125'><small>[125]</small></a> in 1337 to bestow on them a tenement, six perches
by five, lying next their habitation on the east side within the town.
This brings us to the end of the list of grants of landed property to the
Oxford Minorites&mdash;a list which we may claim to be fairly complete. It is
interesting to note from what classes the donors were drawn. Most of them
were men of business&mdash;the leading tradesmen of the town<a name='fna_126' id='fna_126' href='#f_126'><small>[126]</small></a>. Three of
them, Laurence Wych, John Culvard, and Richard Cary, were at various times
Mayors of Oxford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> and the two latter represented the city in
Parliament<a name='fna_127' id='fna_127' href='#f_127'><small>[127]</small></a>. Richard Mepham belonged to the higher rank of
ecclesiastics. Master Thomas de Valeynes seems to have been a person of
some importance in Oxfordshire and the adjoining counties<a name='fna_128' id='fna_128' href='#f_128'><small>[128]</small></a>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>Buildings.</b></p>

<p>Of the buildings of the Friars Minors in Oxford we have disappointingly
little information&mdash;with the exception of the boundary wall already
mentioned there are no remains of their house now visible. Excavations
might perhaps yield interesting results, but most of the ground is thickly
built over, and the information derived from the records and other sources
is rarely precise enough to enable us to identify with any certainty the
sites of the various buildings.</p>

<p>For the first twenty years the Friary must have presented a very modest,
not to say mean, appearance, and the brethren were probably contented to
take the accommodation afforded by the houses, which were granted them,
with little alteration. The infirmary built by Agnellus has already been
noticed. After they had been nearly a year in Oxford, the friars built a
small chapel<a name='fna_129' id='fna_129' href='#f_129'><small>[129]</small></a>. In 1232, the King gave them</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘thirty beams in the royal forest of Savernak for the fabric of their
chapel which they are having built at Oxford,’</p></div>

<p>adding that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘if any one in the same bailiwick shall wish to give them timber, the
bailiff shall permit them without hindrance to carry through the
forest free of toll oaks to the number of thirty<a name='fna_130' id='fna_130' href='#f_130'><small>[130]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Probably this refers to the original chapel. It had a choir where the
brethren attended and celebrated divine service<a name='fna_131' id='fna_131' href='#f_131'><small>[131]</small></a>, and at, or over, the
door of which stood a crucifix, or wooden cross<a name='fna_132' id='fna_132' href='#f_132'><small>[132]</small></a>. It was here, in the
choir before the altar, that Agnellus was buried in a ‘leaden box,’ as
became the <i>zelator paupertatis</i><a name='fna_133' id='fna_133' href='#f_133'><small>[133]</small></a>. The chapel was pulled down when the
new church was finished<a name='fna_134' id='fna_134' href='#f_134'><small>[134]</small></a>. Under the auspices of Agnellus rose their
first school, which was apparently the finest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> their early
buildings<a name='fna_135' id='fna_135' href='#f_135'><small>[135]</small></a>. Whether this was afterwards enlarged, or whether new
schools were built on the same site or elsewhere, there is no longer any
means of deciding.</p>

<p>These houses were situated within the wall, and it was not till the
increase of the ‘area’ between 1240 and 1250 that building on a large
scale was commenced between the wall and Trill Mill Stream<a name='fna_136' id='fna_136' href='#f_136'><small>[136]</small></a>. The
tendency to build was strenuously resisted by the stricter party among the
friars&mdash;the party which upheld the early traditions of the Order.
Eccleston relates how an Oxford friar appeared after death to the
custodian and warned him that,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘if the friars were not damned for their excess in building, they
would at any rate be severely punished<a name='fna_137' id='fna_137' href='#f_137'><small>[137]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>An obscure passage in a letter of Adam Marsh probably refers to the same
tendency; even novices, he laments, are taught to neglect the things of
the spirit</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘for flesh and blood, for mud and walls, for wood and stone, for any
kind of worldly gain<a name='fna_138' id='fna_138' href='#f_138'><small>[138]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The opposition of the older generation was, however, unavailing, and a
‘stately and magnificent<a name='fna_139' id='fna_139' href='#f_139'><small>[139]</small></a>’ convent began to rise. But of the new
friary, too, there are but scanty notices. No English king bestowed on the
house of Franciscans at Oxford that loving care which Henry III bestowed
on the Minorite Church at Reading, or Edward II on the Dominican Church
which rose over the tomb of his ill-fated favourite at Langley. From royal
grants we learn that building was going on at the Grey Friars of Oxford in
1240, when ten oaks were given to them by the King for timber<a name='fna_140' id='fna_140' href='#f_140'><small>[140]</small></a>. In
1245 (July 7th),</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the Sheriff of Berkshire was ordered to give to the Friars Minors of
Oxford for the works of their houses sixty shillings instead of six
oaks which the King gave them before<a name='fna_141' id='fna_141' href='#f_141'><small>[141]</small></a>;’</p></div>

<p>and a further grant of six oaks for timber in 1272 shows that the
operations were of a protracted nature<a name='fna_142' id='fna_142' href='#f_142'><small>[142]</small></a>. From similar sources we find
that the Church, which was dedicated to St. Francis, was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> process of
erection in February, 1246<a name='fna_143' id='fna_143' href='#f_143'><small>[143]</small></a>, and February, 1248<a name='fna_144' id='fna_144' href='#f_144'><small>[144]</small></a>. At the latter
date the friars are again permitted to</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘enclose the street which extends under the wall of Oxford from the
Watergate ... to the small postern in the wall near the Castle.... We
grant also that the north side of the chapel built and to be built in
the aforesaid street may supply the interruption of the wall as far as
it is to reach, the other breaches in the wall being fully repaired as
before, except the small postern in the wall, through which the said
friars can go and return from the new place where they now live, to
the former place in which they used to live.’</p></div>

<p>It would appear from this that the street was outside the wall. Mr.
Parker, however, states positively that it was ‘the inner road’ which they
were permitted to enclose<a name='fna_145' id='fna_145' href='#f_145'><small>[145]</small></a>; in Wheeler’s Garden, south-west of St.
Ebbe’s Churchyard, there used to be a line of old walling, running
parallel to the city wall inside, and the space between these walls may
have been the street in question<a name='fna_146' id='fna_146' href='#f_146'><small>[146]</small></a>. It must be remembered, however,
that the friars had already in 1244 acquired the road with the right to
enclose it, and to throw down this section of the city wall. In 1248,
therefore, we may well believe that little existed of the wall, which on
the south side was never a very prominent feature. The church running due
east and west would extend along and across the site of the wall, the west
end being outside, the east end inside. From the south end of Paradise
Place, where the wall juts out southwards for a few yards, to a point
about the north end of King’s Terrace, there have long been no signs of
the city wall; and it is probably here that the Grey Friars’ Church stood.
The tradition is still preserved in the name Church Place. Of the
appearance of the church we know little. The roof was tiled<a name='fna_147' id='fna_147' href='#f_147'><small>[147]</small></a>, like
that of the Grey Friars’ Church at Reading; it is probable the east end
was flat, and there was no triforium<a name='fna_148' id='fna_148' href='#f_148'><small>[148]</small></a>. Wood thinks that one of the
eight towers which figured in the pageant at the inthronization of Warham
in 1504,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> represented the tower of the Grey Friars<a name='fna_149' id='fna_149' href='#f_149'><small>[149]</small></a>. William of
Worcester has left a somewhat puzzling<a name='fna_150' id='fna_150' href='#f_150'><small>[150]</small></a> description of the church in
1480<a name='fna_151' id='fna_151' href='#f_151'><small>[151]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘The length of the choir of the church of St. Francis at Oxford

the west window contains 90 steps; so in the whole length it contains
150 (?) steps. The width of the nave of the said church on the east
(<i>ab orienti parte</i>) contains with the aisle 28 steps. The length of
the nave from the south side to the north door contains 40 steps only,
and there are ten chapels in the said north nave of the church. The
width of the north nave of the church contains 20 steps. The width of
each chapel contains 6 steps, and so the width of the whole nave of
the church with the ten chapels contains 26 steps. And each chapel
contains in length 6 steps. And each glass window of the ten chapels
contains three dayes (or lights) glazed.’</p></div>

<p>Reckoning William’s ‘steps’ at half a yard each<a name='fna_152' id='fna_152' href='#f_152'><small>[152]</small></a>, and correcting his
apparent mistake in addition, we find that the church measured
seventy-nine yards from east to west, the choir containing thirty-four
yards, and the nave forty-five. At its widest part the church measured
twenty yards, ten yards of which were taken up by the north aisle. Hence
the width of the nave properly so called, and of the choir, which in
friars’ churches is, where it exists, of the same width as the nave<a name='fna_153' id='fna_153' href='#f_153'><small>[153]</small></a>,
was ten yards. The choir was aisleless, and the north aisle was probably
the only one in the church: this, too, narrowed from ten yards to four
towards the east end of the nave. In 1535 Friar Henry Standish, Bishop of
St. Asaph, bequeathed £40 ‘for the building of an aisle joining to the
church of the Grey friars, Oxon<a name='fna_154' id='fna_154' href='#f_154'><small>[154]</small></a>,’ probably on the south side, but it
is almost certain that this was never built.</p>

<p>The wider aisle must have extended nearly the whole length of the nave to
allow space for the north door and the ten chapels, all of which were
built on to the north wall. They would be in part sepulchral chantries,
supported by noble families or gilds, often containing the image or shrine
of some saint, while the shrine of the patron saint stood behind the high
altar. They were presumably later additions, and whether the church in its
original form attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> the proportions here described must remain
doubtful. But there is no reason to suppose it was afterwards enlarged to
any great extent. In the thirteenth century, benefactors, great and small,
were willing and eager to help the friars to raise those splendid
buildings which drew forth the fierce denunciations of later reformers;
and though much of the church was doubtless built, like that at London,
‘from good common alms<a name='fna_155' id='fna_155' href='#f_155'><small>[155]</small></a>,’ there can be little question that the chief
‘founder and benefactor’ was the wealthy Richard Plantagenet, Earl of
Cornwall, and King of the Romans<a name='fna_156' id='fna_156' href='#f_156'><small>[156]</small></a>. It was in the choir of this church
that his heart was buried<a name='fna_157' id='fna_157' href='#f_157'><small>[157]</small></a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘under a sumptuous pyramid of admirable workmanship<a name='fna_158' id='fna_158' href='#f_158'><small>[158]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Here, too, five years later the remains of his third wife, Beatrice of
Falkenstein, were interred, ‘before the great altar<a name='fna_159' id='fna_159' href='#f_159'><small>[159]</small></a>;’ and many other
monuments of nobles and famous men must have given the interior of the
church an imposing appearance. Among those buried here were several of the
Golafres: the tomb of Sir John Golafre, who died at Quinton, Bucks, in
1379<a name='fna_160' id='fna_160' href='#f_160'><small>[160]</small></a>, was in the chancel; that of his younger brother, William, was
probably in the same part of the church<a name='fna_161' id='fna_161' href='#f_161'><small>[161]</small></a>. Sir John’s illegitimate son,
John Golafre, knight and lord of Langley, bequeathed his body to be buried
next his father’s, if he should die in England<a name='fna_162' id='fna_162' href='#f_162'><small>[162]</small></a>; but</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘at the time of his death (1396) he altered his will in that part in
which he bequeathed his body to be buried in the chancel of the church
of the Friars Minors at Oxford, and willed and also bequeathed his
body to be buried in the Conventual Church of Westminster where our
lord the King shall dispose<a name='fna_163' id='fna_163' href='#f_163'><small>[163]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>William Lord Lovell, by a will dated 18 March, 1454/5, made provision</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘to be buried at the Grayfreris of Oxenford in suche place as I have
appoynted<a name='fna_164' id='fna_164' href='#f_164'><small>[164]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The wills of less distinguished persons occasionally contain information
as to the interior of the church. In 1430 Robert Keneyshame, Bedel of the
University, willed to be buried in the Franciscan Church,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘in the midst between the two altars beneath the highest cross in the
body of the church<a name='fna_165' id='fna_165' href='#f_165'><small>[165]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>James Hedyan, bachelor in both laws and principal of Eagle Hall, was
buried in the nave<a name='fna_166' id='fna_166' href='#f_166'><small>[166]</small></a>. Agnes, wife of Michael Norton, was in 1438 buried</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘in the Conventual Church of the Friars Minors of Oxford before the
image of the blessed Mary the Virgin of Pity<a name='fna_167' id='fna_167' href='#f_167'><small>[167]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>And in 1526 Richard Leke, ‘late bruer of Oxford,’ desired</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘to be buried within the Graye ffreres in Oxford before the awter
where the first masse is daily vsed to be saide<a name='fna_168' id='fna_168' href='#f_168'><small>[168]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>But more honoured than any of these was the ‘fair stone sepulchre<a name='fna_169' id='fna_169' href='#f_169'><small>[169]</small></a>’ in
which the body of Agnellus, the only Provincial Minister known to have
been buried at Oxford, found its final resting place. For the shrine of
Agnellus possessed all the fascination of miraculous association and
miraculous power. When the friars, many years after his death, went in the
night to remove the body from the original chapel before its demolition,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘they found the little leaden box in which it lay, together with the
grave, full of the purest oil, but the body itself with the vestments
uncorrupted and smelling most sweetly<a name='fna_170' id='fna_170' href='#f_170'><small>[170]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Here, too, we are told, was the tomb of one greater than Agnellus; but if
the statement of John Rouse, that Roger Bacon was buried among the
Franciscans at Oxford, is anything more than a tradition, it was perhaps
not in the church, but in the common burial place of the brethren of the
convent, that the Warwick antiquary found his grave<a name='fna_171' id='fna_171' href='#f_171'><small>[171]</small></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>The cloisters, of which we find no mention till the dissolution, were no
doubt situated on the south of the church, round ‘Penson’s Gardens.’
Whether the friars were buried in the cloisters, the garth, the
chapter-house, or ‘the cemetery of the Friars Minors,’ in which John
Dongan was interred in 1464<a name='fna_172' id='fna_172' href='#f_172'><small>[172]</small></a> or sometimes in one place, sometimes in
another, is unknown. On the east of the cloisters would be the
chapter-house<a name='fna_173' id='fna_173' href='#f_173'><small>[173]</small></a>; over it, and joining the church, a dormitory<a name='fna_174' id='fna_174' href='#f_174'><small>[174]</small></a>. On
the south of the cloisters, opposite the church, stood the refectory. It
is possible, but not probable, that the long narrow building stretching
down towards Trill Mill Stream, which is marked in old maps of
Oxford<a name='fna_175' id='fna_175' href='#f_175'><small>[175]</small></a>, was the refectory: Bridge Street marks the site. The library
may have been on the west side of the cloisters, but no hint remains as to
the building or its position, while the contents may be more appropriately
treated elsewhere. The warden’s house is equally unknown; he may perhaps
merely have had rooms set apart in some one of the larger buildings<a name='fna_176' id='fna_176' href='#f_176'><small>[176]</small></a>,
as was probably the case with the vice-warden<a name='fna_177' id='fna_177' href='#f_177'><small>[177]</small></a>. From the Lanercost
Chronicle we learn that in the thirteenth century the ‘master of the
schools’ had a chamber of his own<a name='fna_178' id='fna_178' href='#f_178'><small>[178]</small></a>; and Wiclif tells us that in his
time</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Capped Friars, that beene called Maisters of Diuinitie, haue there
chamber and service as Lords or Kings<a name='fna_179' id='fna_179' href='#f_179'><small>[179]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Ample accommodation for guests was a marked feature in most religious
houses, and there is no reason to suppose that the Oxford Franciscan
Friary formed an exception to a custom which, while it excited some
animosity against the apostles of poverty, tended to ensure the favour and
secure the alms of the rich<a name='fna_180' id='fna_180' href='#f_180'><small>[180]</small></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>The convent was supplied with good water by a conduit of leaden pipes,
which, according to Wadding, was made in the thirteenth century by a
magnate at his own expense, and extended many miles under the watersheds
of the Isis and Cherwell<a name='fna_181' id='fna_181' href='#f_181'><small>[181]</small></a>. In 1246-7 we hear that the Friars Preachers
and Minors had appropriated many places on the Thames, and had made there
‘ditches and walls and other things<a name='fna_182' id='fna_182' href='#f_182'><small>[182]</small></a>.’ Lastly, there were three gates:
one in Freren Street<a name='fna_183' id='fna_183' href='#f_183'><small>[183]</small></a>, perhaps an entrance to the church through
‘Church Place;’ another in St. Ebbe’s Street, opposite Beef Lane<a name='fna_184' id='fna_184' href='#f_184'><small>[184]</small></a>,
where St Ebbe’s Churchyard now extends; and a third&mdash;their principal
entrance, which existed in Wood’s time&mdash;in Littlegate Street, apparently
where the latter is now joined by Charles Street<a name='fna_185' id='fna_185' href='#f_185'><small>[185]</small></a>.</p>

<p>This completes the list of conventual as distinct from the farm buildings,
and if the account is meagre and unsatisfactory, we may try to console
ourselves with William of Nottingham’s retort, when a friar threatened to
accuse him before the Minister General ‘because the place at London was
not enclosed:’</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘And I will answer to the General, that I did not enter the Order to
build walls<a name='fna_186' id='fna_186' href='#f_186'><small>[186]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>St. Francis himself was always strongly opposed to the learning of his
age.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Tantum habet homo de scientia quantum operatur,’ he said, ‘et
religiosus tantum est bonus orator quantum operatur<a name='fna_187' id='fna_187' href='#f_187'><small>[187]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>But it was inevitable that the missionaries to the towns should be armed
with a knowledge of theology to enable them to cope with the numerous
heresies of the thirteenth century, and with a knowledge of physical
science to enable them to cope with the frequent pestilences caused by the
disregard of sanitary conditions<a name='fna_188' id='fna_188' href='#f_188'><small>[188]</small></a>. In addition to this the influence
of many learned men in the Order could not but be felt; and the early
Franciscans in England were as zealous for learning as for good works.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>‘They were so fervent,’ Eccleston tells us, ‘in hearing the divine law
and in scholastic exercises, that they hesitated not to go every day
to the schools of theology, however distant, barefoot in bitter cold
and deep mud<a name='fna_189' id='fna_189' href='#f_189'><small>[189]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Agnellus, though in Wood’s words ‘he never smelt of an Academy or tasted
of humane learning<a name='fna_190' id='fna_190' href='#f_190'><small>[190]</small></a>,’ frankly recognised the necessity. The school
which he built at Oxford has already been noticed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘but afterwards,’ adds Bartholomew of Pisa<a name='fna_191' id='fna_191' href='#f_191'><small>[191]</small></a>, ‘he had reason for
regret, when he saw the friars bestowing their time on frivolities and
neglecting needful things; for one day when he wished to see what
proficiency they were making, he entered the schools whilst a
disputation was going on, and hearing them wrangling and questioning,
<i>Utrum sit Deus</i>, he cried: “Woe is me, woe is me! Simple brothers
enter Heaven, and learned brothers dispute whether there is a God at
all!” Then he sent 10<i>l.</i> sterling to the Court to buy the Decretals,
that the friars might study them and give over frivolities.’</p></div>

<p>Agnellus rendered the greatest service to his Order by persuading Robert
Grostete, the foremost scholar of his time, and the most influential man
at Oxford, to accept the post of lecturer to the friars<a name='fna_192' id='fna_192' href='#f_192'><small>[192]</small></a>. The exact
date at which he undertook these duties is uncertain. He resigned the
archdeaconries of Northampton and Leicester in 1231, but he may have been
lecturer to the Franciscans some time before this; certainly he was
closely connected with their house at Oxford<a name='fna_193' id='fna_193' href='#f_193'><small>[193]</small></a>. He was resident in the
University in 1234<a name='fna_194' id='fna_194' href='#f_194'><small>[194]</small></a>, and according to both Eccleston<a name='fna_195' id='fna_195' href='#f_195'><small>[195]</small></a> and the
Lanercost Chronicle<a name='fna_196' id='fna_196' href='#f_196'><small>[196]</small></a>, he gave up his lectureship only to accept the
bishopric of Lincoln in 1235.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by Master Peter<a name='fna_197' id='fna_197' href='#f_197'><small>[197]</small></a>, who afterwards became a bishop in
Scotland. The third reader was Master Roger Wesham<a name='fna_198' id='fna_198' href='#f_198'><small>[198]</small></a>, who afterwards
(namely in or before 1239) was made Dean of Lincoln, and then (1245)
Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. The fourth was Master Thomas Wallensis,
who,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘after he had lectured laudably at the Friars’ in the same place, was
appointed (in 1247) to the bishopric of St. David’s in Wales<a name='fna_199' id='fna_199' href='#f_199'><small>[199]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>Thomas was made Archdeacon of Lincoln by Grostete in 1238, at which time
he was lecturing in Paris<a name='fna_200' id='fna_200' href='#f_200'><small>[200]</small></a>; he was then young<a name='fna_201' id='fna_201' href='#f_201'><small>[201]</small></a> and it is probable
that he was already archdeacon when he lectured to the friars at Oxford.</p>

<p>All these men were seculars, not friars: it was important at a time when,
as Roger Bacon says<a name='fna_202' id='fna_202' href='#f_202'><small>[202]</small></a>, ‘the Order of Minors was new and neglected by
the world,’ to secure the services of men of recognised position and
ability. Of Master Peter nothing further is known. The other two were
certainly close friends of Grostete<a name='fna_203' id='fna_203' href='#f_203'><small>[203]</small></a>. Matthew Paris bears testimony to
the high character and learning, the kindness and tact, of Roger
Wesham<a name='fna_204' id='fna_204' href='#f_204'><small>[204]</small></a>. Bacon ranks Thomas Wallensis among ‘the wise men of
old<a name='fna_205' id='fna_205' href='#f_205'><small>[205]</small></a>,’ who studied foreign languages and knew the value of philology;
and even Paris admits that this enemy of monks<a name='fna_206' id='fna_206' href='#f_206'><small>[206]</small></a> was a man of lofty
purpose, and accepted the bishopric of St. David’s, though it was the
poorest see,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘because it was in his native country, Wales, and he desired to
console his wretched fellow countrymen by his presence, advice, and
help<a name='fna_207' id='fna_207' href='#f_207'><small>[207]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The divinity lecturer to the Franciscans or ‘Master of the Schools<a name='fna_208' id='fna_208' href='#f_208'><small>[208]</small></a>,’
as he was also called, had, as such, no status in the University. It is
even doubtful whether he counted as a ‘regent master,’ unless he also
lectured in the University Schools. Thus Adam Marsh protested against
being required by the Masters to subscribe a new statute on the ground</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘that he had three years ago retired from the office of teaching in
their University<a name='fna_209' id='fna_209' href='#f_209'><small>[209]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>But in a letter written shortly before this, and referring to the same
subjects, he mentions that he was ‘lecturing on Holy Scripture’ to the
friars<a name='fna_210' id='fna_210' href='#f_210'><small>[210]</small></a>. The position of the <i>lector</i> was, in fact, not unlike that of
a college tutor, except that he was always a man of proved ability and
long experience. To the friars he was far more than a theological
lecturer; he was a trusted friend, on whose advice and sympathy and help
they might reckon in all the conduct of life. Such at least was the
tradition established by Grostete and carried on by Adam Marsh<a name='fna_211' id='fna_211' href='#f_211'><small>[211]</small></a>. Both
of them men versed in affairs of state, both men of acknowledged weight in
the counsels of the realm<a name='fna_212' id='fna_212' href='#f_212'><small>[212]</small></a>, and fearless opponents of illegality and
oppression, they not only trained the friars in theology and philosophy,
but taught them to comprehend the social needs of the age.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘I return your lordship,’ writes Adam to Grostete<a name='fna_213' id='fna_213' href='#f_213'><small>[213]</small></a>, ‘the breviate
which you wrote, “<i>Of the rule of a kingdom and a tyranny</i>,” as you
sent it, sealed with the seal of the Earl of Leicester;’</p></div>

<p>and Simon de Montfort had frequent consultations with the friar about his
government of Gascony<a name='fna_214' id='fna_214' href='#f_214'><small>[214]</small></a>. It was from their daily intercourse with men
like these that the Oxford Franciscans became, if not the leaders, the
spokesmen of the constitutional movement of the thirteenth century<a name='fna_215' id='fna_215' href='#f_215'><small>[215]</small></a>.
The corpse of Simon de Montfort was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> buried by the Grey Friars of Evesham,
and it is probably to the Franciscan school that the Latin poems in his
honour are to be ascribed<a name='fna_216' id='fna_216' href='#f_216'><small>[216]</small></a>, as well as the form of prayer addressed to
him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">‘Sis pro nobis intercessor<br />
Apud Deum, qui defensor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In terris extiteras<a name='fna_217' id='fna_217' href='#f_217'><small>[217]</small></a>.’</span></p>

<p>The Oxford Franciscans regarded him as a saint and a martyr, though he
died excommunicate, and testified to the miracles which he wrought<a name='fna_218' id='fna_218' href='#f_218'><small>[218]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The <i>lector</i> had also his <i>socius</i><a name='fna_219' id='fna_219' href='#f_219'><small>[219]</small></a>, a younger friar who acted as his
secretary, and whose time was almost entirely at his disposal. The
position of both <i>lector</i> and <i>socius</i> will be best illustrated by two
extracts from the letters of Adam Marsh.</p>

<p>In the first of these<a name='fna_220' id='fna_220' href='#f_220'><small>[220]</small></a>, addressed to the Provincial, he writes that he
has found Friar A. de Hereford, whom the Provincial had assigned to him as
his <i>socius</i>, affectionate and of good character, docile and well-read,
and far more capable than ‘some of those who are appointed by the counsel
of the discreet to instruct in Holy Scripture.’</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘I see,’ he continues, ‘that any friar who is associated with me to
help me in my various<a name='fna_221' id='fna_221' href='#f_221'><small>[221]</small></a> and constant toil, will have to subordinate
his ecclesiastical labours and apply himself continually to supplying
my defects, and directing my goings, and supporting my burdens, though
this might sometimes produce in him virtue and industry and endurance.
Far be from me therefore such impious tyranny, as that I should be
willing to see the great gifts and spiritual progress in the said
friar stunted or retarded or thwarted by any consideration of private
convenience; especially as I can through the Saviour’s pity, be
provided, as I have heretofore been by your grace, with a competent
companion without injury to the general welfare. I have also reason to
think that Friar A., however great be his willingness and energy, will
be unable without bodily suffering and mental disquietude to continue
permanently with me, unless the stringent rules are relaxed in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>his
favour (<i>nisi quatenus urgentia mitigat obedientiae salutaris diurnos
aestus et vigilias nocturnas</i>).</p>

<p>‘... I ask therefore confidently, that you will, if it be not
displeasing to your holy paternity, send to me without delay Friar
Laurence de Sutthon, as my <i>socius</i>, if he consents, and that you will
send Friar A. to London to study, as he himself greatly desires, if it
be your good pleasure. And though Friar Laurence suffer some tolerable
defect, he is yet peculiarly fitted to help me, though vulgar
obstinacy may not think so.’</p></div>

<p>The other letter<a name='fna_222' id='fna_222' href='#f_222'><small>[222]</small></a> is also directed to the Provincial.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘I am not a little surprised,’ he writes, ‘that through some excessive
caution and severity, no provision has yet been made for the beloved
Friar W. de Maddele, who has up to now diligently borne the burden of
teaching (<i>eruditionis impendendae</i>), long since imposed on him. He is
thus compelled, not only to exhaust the vital spirit by excessive
studies, but also to wear out his bodily powers by writing every day
with his own hand, though his strength is not the strength of stone,
nor his flesh the flesh of brass. And while the other friars who have
been deputed to the office of lecturing, especially those to whom he
has succeeded, had great volumes and the assistance of <i>socii</i>
provided for them, he alone does not seem to be cared for; though I
hear that he has a pleasant faculty of lecturing, is acute in arguing,
and in writing and speaking useful and acceptable to both friars and
seculars. It will therefore be for you, if you please, without delay
to take thought for the peace of mind and provide for the advancement
(<i>provectui</i>) of those who study.’</p></div>

<p>The position of the <i>socius</i> probably altered but little after this time.
That of the <i>lector</i> underwent a change. The Franciscans assimilated their
system of teaching to the system in vogue in the University generally:
from the time of Adam Marsh the lecturers to the Franciscans were merely
ordinary Regent Masters in theology belonging to the Order. This will be
evident from a comparison of the dates at which the various lecturers,
whose names have been preserved, held the office: a sufficient number of
these dates has now been recovered, on the indisputable evidence of
contemporary records, to put the matter beyond all doubt<a name='fna_223' id='fna_223' href='#f_223'><small>[223]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The appointment to the lectureship was in the hands of the Provincial
Chapter<a name='fna_224' id='fna_224' href='#f_224'><small>[224]</small></a>; practically the person recommended by the leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> brethren
at Oxford was elected<a name='fna_225' id='fna_225' href='#f_225'><small>[225]</small></a>. This is true of the later as well as of the
earlier lectors. No Minorite could proceed to any degree unless he were
first authorised to do so by papal ordinance or by the election of his
Order<a name='fna_226' id='fna_226' href='#f_226'><small>[226]</small></a>.</p>

<p>According to the Constitutions of Benedict XII, no Minorite might lecture
on the Sentences in a University (<i>i.e.</i> become B.D.),</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘unless he had first lectured on the four books of the Sentences with
the writings of the approved doctors in other <i>studia</i> which are in
the same Order called <i>Generalia</i>,’</p></div>

<p>or in one of certain specified convents<a name='fna_227' id='fna_227' href='#f_227'><small>[227]</small></a>. The friars of the English
province were specially favoured in respect to the degree of D.D. It was
decreed in the General Chapter at Rome in 1411</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘that no one shall be promoted to the degree of master, unless he
first go to Paris, according to the papal statutes and the general
institutes, and do all that he is bound to do, <i>Provincia Angliae
excepta</i><a name='fna_228' id='fna_228' href='#f_228'><small>[228]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>However, the Franciscans at Oxford never obtained the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> which was
enjoyed by the Dominicans at Paris, of being the sole judges of the
fitness of any friars of their own Order for academical degrees<a name='fna_229' id='fna_229' href='#f_229'><small>[229]</small></a>. In
the case of Adam Marsh, the term of office was one year<a name='fna_230' id='fna_230' href='#f_230'><small>[230]</small></a>; and this was
probably the general rule<a name='fna_231' id='fna_231' href='#f_231'><small>[231]</small></a>, though the readers might perhaps be
re-elected in the annual Provincial Chapter<a name='fna_232' id='fna_232' href='#f_232'><small>[232]</small></a>. They often remained at
Oxford after the expiry of their year<a name='fna_233' id='fna_233' href='#f_233'><small>[233]</small></a>, and no doubt continued to
lecture, though they ceased to be <i>ex officio</i> representatives of the
friars in their dealings with the University or other bodies.</p>

<p>Even in the earliest times it was found necessary to modify the stringency
of the rule in favour of the lecturers. Visiting and good works were
subordinated to their scholastic duties<a name='fna_234' id='fna_234' href='#f_234'><small>[234]</small></a>. They were provided with more
ample accommodation than the other friars, and their privacy was at
certain times inviolable<a name='fna_235' id='fna_235' href='#f_235'><small>[235]</small></a>. In the Constitutions of Benedict XII (1337)
regulations for their support are given with some detail<a name='fna_236' id='fna_236' href='#f_236'><small>[236]</small></a>. Masters,
lectors, and bachelors in Universities were to be provided with the
necessaries of life by the convents of the places where they lectured. But
their other expenses, such as those connected with the necessary books,
were to be assessed by the General or Provincial Minister and to fall on
the convent from which they were sent; or, if the convent was unable to
‘procure’ the funds, these were to be supplied by the custody or province
in which the native convent of the lecturer was situated. In addition to
this, seculars and members of other religious Orders who attended the
lectures, would no doubt have to pay fees<a name='fna_237' id='fna_237' href='#f_237'><small>[237]</small></a>.</p>

<p>We may reasonably infer that Grostete practised in the Franciscan school
the system of instruction in theology which he subsequently recommended to
the University. When consulted by the latter, he answered that the Regent
Masters in theology ought to take the Old and New Testaments as the only
sure foundations of their teaching and make them the subject of all their
morning lectures, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> the custom of the Doctors of Paris<a name='fna_238' id='fna_238' href='#f_238'><small>[238]</small></a>.
Roger Bacon laments the exaggerated respect which was paid to the
‘Sentences’ in his day, and points out that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the learned men of old, some of whom we have seen, such as Robert
bishop of Lincoln and Friar Adam de Marisco, used only the text’ which
was ‘given to the world from the mouth of God and of the Saints<a name='fna_239' id='fna_239' href='#f_239'><small>[239]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>At the Friary, as in the rest of the University, much of the teaching in
the theological faculty was, even in the thirteenth century, done by
bachelors<a name='fna_240' id='fna_240' href='#f_240'><small>[240]</small></a>; the admission to the degree of B.D. was accompanied by a
licence to ‘lecture on the book of the Sentences.’ Some of the lectures
would probably be for the brethren alone; others were open to the
University<a name='fna_241' id='fna_241' href='#f_241'><small>[241]</small></a>. The latter would certainly be the case when a friar
delivered the lectures, which he was bound to give as ‘Necessary Regent,’
in his monastery. These courses seem however to have been sometimes
delivered in the University Schools in School Street<a name='fna_242' id='fna_242' href='#f_242'><small>[242]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The academic studies of the friars were confined to the faculty of
theology (in its wide mediaeval sense), and of canon law, the ‘handmaid’
of theology. The regulars were for the most part subject to the same
statutes as the secular students in these faculties, with some important
modifications.</p>

<p>The rules of the two Orders forbade their members to take a degree in
Arts<a name='fna_243' id='fna_243' href='#f_243'><small>[243]</small></a>. The customs of the University, on the other hand, required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
that the student of theology should have graduated in Arts<a name='fna_244' id='fna_244' href='#f_244'><small>[244]</small></a>. The issue
was definitely raised in 1253<a name='fna_245' id='fna_245' href='#f_245'><small>[245]</small></a>, and we have from the pen of Adam Marsh
a detailed account of the struggle<a name='fna_246' id='fna_246' href='#f_246'><small>[246]</small></a>. In February the Chancellor and
Masters of the University were formally petitioned to allow Friar Thomas
of York,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘a man of high repute among the great and the many, on account of the
eminence of his character, ability, learning, and experience, to
ascend the chair of ordinary regent in Holy Scripture.’</p></div>

<p>The objection was then raised that he had not ruled in Arts. A committee
of seven was appointed by the Masters to prepare a report, and the
deliberations lasted, with a short interval, the whole of the next
fortnight (Feb. 22 to March 8). On Saturday, March 8, ‘the chancellor and
masters and some bachelors’ assembled to consider the report, which was to
the effect that Friar Thomas should incept this time, but that a statute
should be passed providing that for the future no one should incept in
theology unless he had previously ruled in Arts in some University, and
read one book of the Canon (of the Bible) or of the Sentences, and
publicly preached in the University; the Chancellor and Masters reserved
to themselves the right of granting dispensations, but provided against
the use of undue influence of powerful patrons in procuring such ‘graces’
by the clause:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘but if any one shall attempt to extort a grace from the University
through the influence of any magnate, he shall <i>ipso facto</i> be
expelled from the society of the Masters and deprived of the
privileges of the University<a name='fna_247' id='fna_247' href='#f_247'><small>[247]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The report was at once accepted as the basis of a statute, to be signed by</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the Chancellor and all the regent masters in theology, and Friar Hugh
of Mistretune, and the other regent masters in decrees and laws, and
the two rectors (proctors) for the artists, and Friar Adam called de
Marisco<a name='fna_248' id='fna_248' href='#f_248'><small>[248]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Adam however refused to sign, and the meeting was prorogued till the next
day, the first Sunday in Lent, only to be postponed again till Monday,
when Adam, ‘in the presence of the chancellor, masters, and scholars,’
repeated his objections, adding others. He could not, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> argued, agree to
a statute of which he disapproved, merely to gain his immediate point. The
promised ‘graces’ were fallacious,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘since by the opposition of any one man such a grace could be long
delayed or altogether prevented; thus even the best men would be
rejected, and he who was approved by divinity would be reproved by
inhumanity.’</p></div>

<p>Further, it was unreasonable to require his signature, seeing that he was
now almost a stranger (<i>quasi foras factus</i>), having for three years
retired from the office of lecturing in their University. At length he
formally washed his hands of the whole matter, withdrawing even his
opposition,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘since the measure, dangerous as it was and distasteful to him, did
not seem to him to be conceived in a spirit of wilful injustice,’
(<i>non videtur secundum planum sui praeferre iniquitatem</i>).</p></div>

<p>He then left the assembly, while the seven commissioners withdrew to
decide on the terms of the statute, which was merely a recapitulation of
the original report. The Chancellor at once sent Adam the final decision,
‘written with his own hand,’ which the latter duly forwarded to the
Provincial Minister. He left Oxford on Wednesday, the very day on which
the statute was passed, while Thomas of York celebrated his ‘vesperies’ on
Thursday and his inception on Friday, under the presidency of Friar Peter
de Manners. In view of the bitterness which marked both the contemporary
struggle between the University and Mendicants at Paris, and the disputes
between the University and Dominicans at Oxford sixty years later, it is
impossible not to be struck with the good feeling and moderation displayed
both by Adam and his opponents.</p>

<p>The controversy at the beginning of the fourteenth century was to a large
extent the sequel to the events we have just related<a name='fna_249' id='fna_249' href='#f_249'><small>[249]</small></a>. The Dominicans
in 1311 appealed first to the King, and when this proved of no avail, to
the Pope, complaining that graces were frequently refused to fit
candidates, and demanding the repeal of the statute of 1253. The appeal
was read in the church of the Minorites,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘in the presence of a vast multitude of people there assembled on the
occasion of a public sermon to the clerks,’</p></div>

<p>but the Franciscans took no active part in the matter, and the details of
the struggle belong to the history of the Black Friars. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Mendicant Orders however were no doubt involved in the odium which
attached to the conduct of the Dominicans, and from this time forth the
jealous feeling between the friars and the University never died out.</p>

<p>The issue of the controversy concerned the Franciscans no less than the
Preaching Friars. In 1314 the arbitrators to whom the matter had been
submitted published their award<a name='fna_250' id='fna_250' href='#f_250'><small>[250]</small></a>. The statute of 1253 was upheld, but
the right of refusing to any one, who had not ruled in Arts, the grace to
incept in theology, was practically withdrawn from each individual member
of Congregation and vested in the Regent Masters of the Theological
Faculty.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘On such a grace being asked, every Master shall be bound to swear on
the gospels ... that he will not refuse such grace out of malice,
hatred or rancour, but only for the common utility and honour of the
university. And if notwithstanding this oath such grace be refused by
any one, the reason of the refusal shall at once be set forth in the
same Congregation of Masters in the presence of the Chancellor and
proctors of the university and the Masters ruling in Theology, and
within ten days or less it shall be discussed for the decision of the
university whether that reason be sufficient or not. And if the reason
of the aforesaid refusal be sufficient in the judgment of the Masters
then ruling in Theology or of the majority of them, the refusal of the
grace shall hold good; but if the reason of the refusal be
insufficient in the judgment of the same persons, <i>eo ipso</i> the grace
shall be granted<a name='fna_251' id='fna_251' href='#f_251'><small>[251]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The Dominicans however hoped with the Pope’s assistance<a name='fna_252' id='fna_252' href='#f_252'><small>[252]</small></a> to get more
favourable terms, and it was not till 1320 that they finally submitted to
the University<a name='fna_253' id='fna_253' href='#f_253'><small>[253]</small></a>. The wording of the award was certainly vague and
required explanation. What, for instance, was the meaning of the
expression, ‘the common utility and honour of the university’? It is
probably to this period that the following decree is to be referred, and
it may be regarded as a gloss on the award of 1314<a name='fna_254' id='fna_254' href='#f_254'><small>[254]</small></a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘<i>Item</i>, quod nullus de cetero, nisi prius in artibus rexerit, in
disputatione <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>solemni alicujus doctoris in theologia, publice opponere
permittatur, nisi prius coram Cancellario et Procuratoribus
Universitatis juramentum praestiterit corporale, quod philosophiam per
octo annos, solis philosophicis principaliter intendendo, et postea
theologiam per sex annos completos ad minus audierit, seu partim
audierit et partim legerit, per spatium temporis supradicti: ad
fidelem vero hujus statuti conservationem, noverint doctores in
theologia Regentes se fore specialiter obligatos.’</p></div>

<p>The award of 1314 remained the permanent law of the University, and for
the next century the friars confined themselves to insisting on the due
execution of its provisions. In 1388, Richard II, hearing that,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘contrary to the decision of the aforesaid declaration you maliciously
prevent the friars from taking degrees in theology,’</p></div>

<p>wrote two strongly worded letters to the Chancellor, Proctors, and Regent
Masters of the University, ordering them, ‘under pain of our heavy
displeasure,’ to observe the statute of 1314<a name='fna_255' id='fna_255' href='#f_255'><small>[255]</small></a>. In 1421, in
consideration of remonstrances from the King and the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the University gave a solemn undertaking to carry out the same
statute, with some changes in detail<a name='fna_256' id='fna_256' href='#f_256'><small>[256]</small></a>. So long however as the
condition, that the candidate must have ruled in Arts, was inserted in the
‘form of licensing to incept in theology<a name='fna_257' id='fna_257' href='#f_257'><small>[257]</small></a>,’ the religious felt
themselves to be at a disadvantage in comparison with the seculars, and
bitterly resented their inferiority. When therefore, in 1447, the
University was raising funds for the erection of the new schools, the
Mendicants seized the opportunity to secure the abolition of this clause,
promising in return that each friar should pay 40<i>s.</i> to the University at
the time of receiving the licence<a name='fna_258' id='fna_258' href='#f_258'><small>[258]</small></a>. This may however have been only a
temporary arrangement: the Registers of Congregation supply little
evidence as to its having been carried out<a name='fna_259' id='fna_259' href='#f_259'><small>[259]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The object of these statutes was partly to prevent the regulars from
having an undue advantage over the seculars in the matter of theological
degrees, but they must have had the effect of ensuring to the friars some
preliminary training before the commencement of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> theological
studies. Roger Bacon, as usual, has a decided opinion on the necessity of
such a training. Writing in 1271<a name='fna_260' id='fna_260' href='#f_260'><small>[260]</small></a>, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘During the last forty years there have arisen some in the
Universities (<i>in studio</i>) who have made themselves doctors and
masters of theology and philosophy, though they have never learnt
anything of real value (<i>dignum</i>) and are neither willing nor able to
do so on account of their ‘<i>status</i>.’... They are boys inexperienced
in themselves, in the world, in the learned languages, Greek and
Hebrew; ... they are ignorant of all parts and sciences of mundane
philosophy, when they venture on the study of theology, which demands
all human wisdom.... They are the boys of the two student Orders, like
Albert and Thomas and others, who enter the Orders when they are
twenty years old or less.... Many thousands enter who cannot read the
Psalter or Donatus, and immediately after making their profession,
they are set to study theology.... And so it was right that they
should make no progress, especially when they did not procure
instruction for themselves in philosophy from others after they
entered the Order. And most of all because they have presumed in the
Orders to investigate philosophy by themselves without a teacher&mdash;so
that they have become masters in theology and philosophy before they
were disciples&mdash;therefore infinite error reigns among them.’</p></div>

<p>The Oxford friars however could not have acquired their great scholastic
reputation unless they had been better fitted than the seculars for the
study of theology; and Friar William Woodford had little difficulty in
pointing to many who, having entered the Order in their youth,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘wrote many works of great wisdom, which remain for the advantage of
the Church<a name='fna_261' id='fna_261' href='#f_261'><small>[261]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The clause of the statute of 1253 which prohibited the extortion of graces
or dispensations by means of the letters of influential persons was not
altogether effective. When, in 1358, the bitter feeling against the friars
found a spokesman in Richard Fitzralph and again burst forth into open
hostility, the clause was re-enacted in a more stringent form<a name='fna_262' id='fna_262' href='#f_262'><small>[262]</small></a>. Any
one using such letters was declared for ever incapable of holding or
obtaining any degree at Oxford, and the University determined to hold up
these ‘wax-doctors’ to obloquy.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘These,’ begins a proclamation of the same year<a name='fna_263' id='fna_263' href='#f_263'><small>[263]</small></a>, ‘are the names
of the wax-doctors, as they are called who seek to extort graces from
the University by means of letters of lords sealed with wax, or
because they run from hard study as wax runs from the face of fire. Be
it known that such wax-doctors are always of the Mendicant Orders, the
cause whereof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> we have found<a name='fna_264' id='fna_264' href='#f_264'><small>[264]</small></a>; for by apples and drink, as the
people fables, they draw boys to their religion, and do not instruct
them after their profession, as their age demands, but let them wander
about begging, and waste the time when they could learn, in currying
favour with lords and ladies.... These are their names: Friar Richard
Lymynster incepted in theology by means of the prince’s letters, and
his grace contained the condition that he should incept and not
lecture, but that Friar John Nutone his predecessor should continue
lecturing<a name='fna_265' id='fna_265' href='#f_265'><small>[265]</small></a>: and Friar Giuliortus de Limosano of the Order of
Minors, who asserted that he was secretary of the King of Sicily,
extorted from the University, or rather from the theological faculty,
by letters of the King, grace to oppose.’</p></div>

<p>These instances hardly seem to justify the violent language of the
proclamation, and it is uncertain to what extent the Oxford Minorites were
guilty of the practice here denounced. Wiclif repeats the charge against
the Mendicants generally:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘A what cursedness is this, to a dead man, as to the world, and pride
and vanitie thereof, to get him a cap of masterdom by praier of
Lords<a name='fna_266' id='fna_266' href='#f_266'><small>[266]</small></a>!’</p></div>

<p>It remains for us to give an account of the academic, or rather scholastic
career of a Friar Minor at Oxford. As many of the friars entered the Order
in tender years, there is no doubt that boys’ schools formed part of many
of the friaries<a name='fna_267' id='fna_267' href='#f_267'><small>[267]</small></a>. There is no evidence of such a school at Oxford, but
at Paris one existed where the student friars received a preliminary
education<a name='fna_268' id='fna_268' href='#f_268'><small>[268]</small></a>. It is probable that the names of friars who showed ability
were sent up by the various convents to the Provincial Chapter and that a
certain number were elected by the ‘discreet men’ there assembled to go to
the University<a name='fna_269' id='fna_269' href='#f_269'><small>[269]</small></a>. There is no evidence of any definite rule fixing the
number or proportion of friars who might be sent from each convent,
custody, or province, to Oxford<a name='fna_270' id='fna_270' href='#f_270'><small>[270]</small></a>. The average number of friars living
in the convent at Oxford at any time during the last quarter of the
thirteenth and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> first half of the fourteenth century was probably
between seventy and eighty<a name='fna_271' id='fna_271' href='#f_271'><small>[271]</small></a>.</p>

<p>A friar usually completed his eight years’ study of Arts, and often began
his course of theology<a name='fna_272' id='fna_272' href='#f_272'><small>[272]</small></a>, at his native convent. On coming up to Oxford
he at once entered on or continued his theological studies. A secular
student of Divinity during his first three years attended ‘cursory’
lectures on the Bible and was admitted to oppose after the end of the
fourth year<a name='fna_273' id='fna_273' href='#f_273'><small>[273]</small></a>. In the friaries the course of study would in the main
correspond with that adopted by the University. After six years<a name='fna_274' id='fna_274' href='#f_274'><small>[274]</small></a>
(instead of four) spent chiefly in the study of the Bible, a friar was
presented by his teacher, a Regent Master of the same Order<a name='fna_275' id='fna_275' href='#f_275'><small>[275]</small></a>, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> the
Chancellor and Proctors; special enquiry was then made as to his knowledge
of the liberal arts, his age, morals, and stature; and if he satisfied the
University officers on these points, he was admitted to ‘oppose in
theology<a name='fna_276' id='fna_276' href='#f_276'><small>[276]</small></a>.’ Two more years elapsed before he could become a
‘respondent<a name='fna_277' id='fna_277' href='#f_277'><small>[277]</small></a>.’ Opposition or opponency and responsion were the two
sides of a disputation: some question in theology was proposed, probably
by the Master of the Schools; the opponent took one side (affirmative or
negative) and <i>put</i> his case; the respondent then had to take the other
side. The difficulty of the respondent’s task was probably augmented by
his having to answer the arguments of more than one opponent<a name='fna_278' id='fna_278' href='#f_278'><small>[278]</small></a>. These
regulations however were apparently superseded in 1358, when it was
enacted that no religious who had not ruled in Arts should presume to read
the Sentences until he had opposed duly and publicly a whole year in the
ordinary disputations of the Masters, no other person of the same Order
opposing at the same time<a name='fna_279' id='fna_279' href='#f_279'><small>[279]</small></a>. This appears to have been the theory, and
to some extent the practice, during the times about which we have any
detailed information&mdash;i.e. the period covered by the early Registers. In
none of the supplications and graces of the Minorites is there mention of
the lapse of two years or anything approaching it between opponency and
responsion; the latter exercise indeed is usually coupled with opponency,
and treated as a very secondary affair<a name='fna_280' id='fna_280' href='#f_280'><small>[280]</small></a>. A few instances will be
sufficient as illustrations. In 1515 a grace was granted to Friar W.
German, scholar of theology, with the stipulation that half a year should
elapse between his opposition and responsion; the condition was
subsequently withdrawn at German’s request<a name='fna_281' id='fna_281' href='#f_281'><small>[281]</small></a>. In 1457, Friar Gonsalvo
of Portugal supplicated that he might count two terms of opponency as a
year<a name='fna_282' id='fna_282' href='#f_282'><small>[282]</small></a>; Richard Ednam in 1455 was allowed to count eight oppositions
<i>pro completa forma oppositionis</i><a name='fna_283' id='fna_283' href='#f_283'><small>[283]</small></a>. Friar John Smith was admitted B.D.
six months after he was admitted to oppose<a name='fna_284' id='fna_284' href='#f_284'><small>[284]</small></a>. The opponent had to
dispute in each of the Schools of the Masters in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
theology<a name='fna_285' id='fna_285' href='#f_285'><small>[285]</small></a>; towards
the end of our period, oppositions were held in the new Schools of
theology<a name='fna_286' id='fna_286' href='#f_286'><small>[286]</small></a>.</p>

<p>After nine years spent in theological study, the friar might be admitted
to read the <i>Sentences</i> of Peter Lombard publicly in the Schools<a name='fna_287' id='fna_287' href='#f_287'><small>[287]</small></a>,
that is, to take the degree of B.D. On the presentation of the candidate
to the Chancellor and Proctors, one at least of the Regents in theology
must swear that he <i>knew</i> him to be a fit person in morals and learning,
the other Regents, that they <i>believed</i> him to be such<a name='fna_288' id='fna_288' href='#f_288'><small>[288]</small></a>. Within a year
from this time<a name='fna_289' id='fna_289' href='#f_289'><small>[289]</small></a>, the new Bachelor had to begin his lectures on the
<i>Sentences</i>, which he continued for a year (three terms), reading the text
on most of the ‘legible’ days of each term, with questions or arguments
pertinent to the matter, giving the accepted interpretation. He was not to
raise doubtful points or attack the conclusions of another, more than once
a term, except at the first and last lectures on each book of the
<i>Sentences</i><a name='fna_290' id='fna_290' href='#f_290'><small>[290]</small></a>. In the first year also, he had to preach an examinatory
sermon, which before 1303 was usually held at the Black or Grey Friars,
after that date at St. Mary’s<a name='fna_291' id='fna_291' href='#f_291'><small>[291]</small></a>; another Latin sermon, ‘<i>qui non sit
examinatorius</i>’ at St. Mary’s<a name='fna_292' id='fna_292' href='#f_292'><small>[292]</small></a>; and a third, before his inception, in
the Dominican church, according to the statute of 1314<a name='fna_293' id='fna_293' href='#f_293'><small>[293]</small></a>. In the next
two years he had to continue his studies, and perhaps lecture on a book of
the canon of the Bible<a name='fna_294' id='fna_294' href='#f_294'><small>[294]</small></a>: the lecturing in this case was apparently to
be done <i>biblice</i>; i.e. without commenting or discussing questions,
except only on the text (<i>quaestiones ... literales</i>)<a name='fna_295' id='fna_295' href='#f_295'><small>[295]</small></a>. Further, after
the lapse of a year from the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> of his lectures on the Sentences,
he had to respond to eight Regents in theology separately (or to all if
there were less than eight); all or most of these responsions were to be
‘ordinary,’ or at least ‘concursive’ (<i>concursivae</i>), and responsions at
vesperies and inceptions were included in the eight<a name='fna_296' id='fna_296' href='#f_296'><small>[296]</small></a>. Whether the rest
of these responsions took place at the terminal disputations in the
Theology School is not quite clear; but a later statute (1583) provides
that none of these terminal disputations shall count to any one ‘<i>pro
forma</i><a name='fna_297' id='fna_297' href='#f_297'><small>[297]</small></a>.’ The responsions were latterly held in the new schools:
before these were built, in the schools of the various Masters. The
Bachelor had then completed the studies necessary for the degree of S.T.P.
or D.D.</p>

<p>These exercises seem usually to have been insisted on, more or less fully,
even in the century before the Reformation. Friar John Sunday in 1454,
having finished his lectures on the Sentences, supplicated for leave to
incept after responding to each of the doctors and completing his course
on the Bible: the grace was conceded on condition that he should respond
and oppose eight times ‘<i>pro forma</i>,’ and respond twice ‘<i>preter
formam</i><a name='fna_298' id='fna_298' href='#f_298'><small>[298]</small></a>.’ Friar Thomas Anyden, S.T.B., supplicated (1507) that three
responsions in the new schools with an examinatory sermon and
‘<i>introitus</i>’ of the Bible should suffice that he should be admitted to
incept<a name='fna_299' id='fna_299' href='#f_299'><small>[299]</small></a>. It was rarely that three years intervened before the
admission to read the Sentences and inception<a name='fna_300' id='fna_300' href='#f_300'><small>[300]</small></a>. Thus Friar Gilbert
Saunders was admitted to oppose in Nov. 1511, and incepted in July
1513<a name='fna_301' id='fna_301' href='#f_301'><small>[301]</small></a>. Friar John Smyth was admitted B.D. in Dec. 1512, and D.D. in
July 1513<a name='fna_302' id='fna_302' href='#f_302'><small>[302]</small></a>. Another of the same name however was allowed to incept in
1507 if he had spent four years in the study of theology after taking the
bachelor’s degree<a name='fna_303' id='fna_303' href='#f_303'><small>[303]</small></a>.</p>

<p>We now come to the exercises and ceremonies connected with inception.
First the grace had to be asked of Congregation; there was no fixed time
for doing this<a name='fna_304' id='fna_304' href='#f_304'><small>[304]</small></a>. Secondly came the ‘deponing,’ which was done by all
the regent masters in the faculty present; all of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> had to swear that
they <i>knew</i> the candidate to be a fit person; he must be of good life and
honest conversation and not deformed in body (<i>corpore vitiati</i>)<a name='fna_305' id='fna_305' href='#f_305'><small>[305]</small></a>. He
then received in the ordinary form the Chancellor’s licence to incept,
after swearing to observe the statutes of the University and to incept
within a year of his admission<a name='fna_306' id='fna_306' href='#f_306'><small>[306]</small></a>.</p>

<p>On the day preceding the day fixed for his ‘vesperies,’ the licentiate
sent to each Master of Theology and requested him to attend the latter
ceremony<a name='fna_307' id='fna_307' href='#f_307'><small>[307]</small></a>. Theological vesperies were in the thirteenth century held
in the various schools; a Franciscan celebrated his vesperies in the
school or church of the convent under the presidency of his own
master<a name='fna_308' id='fna_308' href='#f_308'><small>[308]</small></a>. At the beginning of the fourteenth century, a statute was
passed enacting that every inceptor in theology should celebrate his
vesperies in St. Mary’s Church<a name='fna_309' id='fna_309' href='#f_309'><small>[309]</small></a>. It does not seem that the masters in
the faculty were bound to attend<a name='fna_310' id='fna_310' href='#f_310'><small>[310]</small></a>, but the prospect of an important or
exciting discussion often attracted a large audience<a name='fna_311' id='fna_311' href='#f_311'><small>[311]</small></a>. The exercises
at vesperies consisted of disputations on theological questions proposed
probably by the candidate<a name='fna_312' id='fna_312' href='#f_312'><small>[312]</small></a>, and announced to Congregation. All the
masters present both at vesperies and at the Act had the right to bring
forward their arguments in turn<a name='fna_313' id='fna_313' href='#f_313'><small>[313]</small></a>. Thus Friar Hugh of Hertepol (c.
1280-1290) disputed ‘in the vesperies before the inception of Friar John
de Persole at Oxford<a name='fna_314' id='fna_314' href='#f_314'><small>[314]</small></a>.’ About the same time ‘Sneyt (debated) a
question in the vesperies of Robert de Bromyard; Thomas of Malmesbury,
preacher, responded<a name='fna_315' id='fna_315' href='#f_315'><small>[315]</small></a>.’ The proceedings were terminated by a speech
delivered by the presiding master in praise of the inceptor<a name='fna_316' id='fna_316' href='#f_316'><small>[316]</small></a>. Grostete
is said to have presided and given the oration at the vesperies of Adam
Marsh<a name='fna_317' id='fna_317' href='#f_317'><small>[317]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Inception followed the next day. Even this ceremony in the thirteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
century took place sometimes in the churches of the friars<a name='fna_318' id='fna_318' href='#f_318'><small>[318]</small></a>; but at
the beginning of the fourteenth century, it was certainly the custom to
hold the Act in St. Mary’s<a name='fna_319' id='fna_319' href='#f_319'><small>[319]</small></a>. The inceptor was admitted into the gild
of Masters by one of the Masters (not the Chancellor), who was called the
Father<a name='fna_320' id='fna_320' href='#f_320'><small>[320]</small></a>. In the case of a Franciscan, the Father would usually, though
not always, be a doctor of the same Order<a name='fna_321' id='fna_321' href='#f_321'><small>[321]</small></a>. Those about to incept
first read their lectures, then opened a discussion on certain
questions<a name='fna_322' id='fna_322' href='#f_322'><small>[322]</small></a>. In later times the exercises consisted of the discussion
by all the inceptors, as opponents, of three questions proposed by the
respondent and sanctioned by Congregation; the respondent, while
statutably a D.D., was usually some M.A. or B.D. who was allowed to count
this responsion <i>pro forma</i><a name='fna_323' id='fna_323' href='#f_323'><small>[323]</small></a>. In the more vigorous days of
scholasticism, it is probable that the disputation was more of a
reality&mdash;that the inceptor (who took the part of opponent) chose his own
subjects<a name='fna_324' id='fna_324' href='#f_324'><small>[324]</small></a> and was answered by a rival among the
doctors<a name='fna_325' id='fna_325' href='#f_325'><small>[325]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Many of the questions discussed at vesperies, inceptions, and other
disputations at Oxford at the end of the thirteenth century&mdash;probably in
the convent of the Minorites&mdash;are preserved in a manuscript at
Assisi<a name='fna_326' id='fna_326' href='#f_326'><small>[326]</small></a>. The question on which Friar Hugh of Hertepol disputed at the
vesperies of Friar John de Persole was: <i>An Christus in primo instanti
potuit mereri perfectione</i>. Other questions of the same Friar Hugh were:
<i>An deus eadem ratione formali videatur trinus et unus</i>, <i>An incarnacio sit
possibilis</i>. The following are also among the questions in the same
volume: <i>Utrum deus sit infinite potencie</i>, <i>Utrum virgo concepit sine
semine</i>, <i>An intellectus sit forma corporis</i>, <i>An deus sit in omnibus
rebus</i>, <i>An omnes beati equaliter participant beatitudine</i>, <i>An ratio
ymaginis est in actuali visione dei</i>.</p>

<p>We may next enquire how far the statutable requirements as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> period
of study were carried out: the only evidence obtainable is from the
registers, which begin about 1450. The statutes, as we have seen, required
that a religious should have studied Arts (i.e. philosophy) and Theology
for fourteen years before opponency. The periods mentioned in the
supplications vary from sixteen to eight years, the most usual number of
years being twelve. Before inception, six more years of study were
demanded, i.e. twenty in all. The period in the supplications varies from
fourteen to twenty years; the usual number is eighteen. There is however
reason to believe that these figures are not very exact. We have no means
of checking them with regard to opponency, and the University was probably
in the same position. But it frequently happened, that a friar, who had
been admitted to oppose on the ground of having studied ‘logic, philosophy
and theology’ for twelve years, supplicated two years later or less for
grace to incept on the plea that he had studied the same subjects for
eighteen years<a name='fna_327' id='fna_327' href='#f_327'><small>[327]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The expenses at inception were very heavy. The <i>religiosi</i> wore their
usual habit<a name='fna_328' id='fna_328' href='#f_328'><small>[328]</small></a>, and Mendicants were exempted from the payment of
‘commons’ to the University<a name='fna_329' id='fna_329' href='#f_329'><small>[329]</small></a>. Further, when several inmates of the
same convent incepted on the same day, the charges (fees to the bedells
and others?) were the same as for one inceptor<a name='fna_330' id='fna_330' href='#f_330'><small>[330]</small></a>. But these details did
not touch the largest expenses. According to ancient custom, every
inceptor on the day of his inception feasted the Regent Masters
(apparently of all faculties)<a name='fna_331' id='fna_331' href='#f_331'><small>[331]</small></a>, and Wiclif inveighs against the
Mendicant Doctors for their</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘great gifts and making of huge feasts of a hundred and many hundred
pounds<a name='fna_332' id='fna_332' href='#f_332'><small>[332]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Friar William Woodford, Wiclif’s contemporary, started from London to take
his D.D. with £40 in his purse<a name='fna_333' id='fna_333' href='#f_333'><small>[333]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Attempts were made to curtail the expenses of the friars. In his
constitutions for the reformation of the Franciscan Order in 1336, Pope
Benedict XII decreed<a name='fna_334' id='fna_334' href='#f_334'><small>[334]</small></a>, that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>‘at inceptions<a name='fna_335' id='fna_335' href='#f_335'><small>[335]</small></a> of Masters of the Order in theology, or of
bachelors beginning the Sentences, they shall not spend in food and
drink, except once only, more than would suffice for the moderate
refection of the convent of the place where such inceptions take
place. Other bachelors, lecturers or other students, both at Paris and
at other <i>studia generalia</i> and <i>studia particularia</i>, shall not spend
anything at their own inception or scholastic act or at the inception
or act of others.’</p></div>

<p>It became usual, both among religious and seculars, to commute the
expenses of the feast for a fixed money payment to the University.
According to the scale fixed by statute in 1478<a name='fna_336' id='fna_336' href='#f_336'><small>[336]</small></a>, seculars who were
able to spend at the University more than £40 and less than £100 (a year),
paid twenty marks in lieu of the feast; those able to spend £100 or more,
paid £20. A monk’s composition was assessed at twenty marks; a friar’s at
ten marks or £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> (equivalent to about £80 of present money).
The sums actually paid by the Franciscans varied considerably. Sometimes
the statutable amount was paid<a name='fna_337' id='fna_337' href='#f_337'><small>[337]</small></a>. Friar John Whytwell (1449/50) paid
£10<a name='fna_338' id='fna_338' href='#f_338'><small>[338]</small></a>. Friar Richard Ednam (1463) was required to give £15, as well as
a <i>liberata</i> to the Regents <i>ex sumptu proprio</i><a name='fna_339' id='fna_339' href='#f_339'><small>[339]</small></a>. More often
(especially in the sixteenth century) a reduction of the sum was granted
by the University, the concession being usually accompanied by the
condition that the friar should say masses <i>pro bono statu
Regentium</i><a name='fna_340' id='fna_340' href='#f_340'><small>[340]</small></a>. Friar Thomas Anneday was allowed to pay seven marks,
‘because he is poor and has few friends<a name='fna_341' id='fna_341' href='#f_341'><small>[341]</small></a>.’ Others obtained a reduction
of their composition by one half<a name='fna_342' id='fna_342' href='#f_342'><small>[342]</small></a>; or the whole sum might be remitted
under certain conditions, as in the case of Friar Nicholas de Burgo<a name='fna_343' id='fna_343' href='#f_343'><small>[343]</small></a>.
Sometimes Congregation refused to allow the full reduction asked for<a name='fna_344' id='fna_344' href='#f_344'><small>[344]</small></a>.</p>

<p>It was further customary for inceptors to provide robes for masters and
others attending their inception. Perhaps a trace of this custom may be
seen in the grace to Friar Gonsalvo of Portugal, who at his inception was
to</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>‘give a livery, i.e. <i>cultellos</i>, according to the ancient practice,
to all the Regents<a name='fna_345' id='fna_345' href='#f_345'><small>[345]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>During the period of necessary regency, which followed inception, a
secular had the right to attend all meetings of Congregation, and was
bound to deliver ‘ordinary’ lectures publicly in the schools for the
remainder of the year in which he incepted and the whole of the following
year<a name='fna_346' id='fna_346' href='#f_346'><small>[346]</small></a>. A statute of 1478 states the custom as enforced in the case of
the Mendicants<a name='fna_347' id='fna_347' href='#f_347'><small>[347]</small></a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Every one of them so incepting shall be bound to necessary regency
for twenty-four months to be reckoned continuously from the day of his
inception, including vacations, or he shall be regent and pay to the
University according to the ancient customs; and although it happen
that some other of the same Order incept within the term of the said
months, he shall yet be bound to observe the foresaid form of regency,
so that however only one of them come to the house of Congregation,
according to the custom hitherto in use; proviso, that none of them
shall omit to lecture (<i>expendet</i>) more than thirty days in a year by
virtue of any grace whether general or special.’</p></div>

<p>Perhaps the exclusion of the friars, except one of each Order, from the
house of Congregation and consequently from the government of the
University, dates from the middle of the fourteenth century<a name='fna_348' id='fna_348' href='#f_348'><small>[348]</small></a>. In 1454
Friar John David, S.T.P., supplicated for leave</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘to resume his ordinary lectures and exercise the acts of regent
excepting the entry to the house of Congregation<a name='fna_349' id='fna_349' href='#f_349'><small>[349]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Dispensations from necessary regency were often obtained. In 1452 Friar
Anthony de Vallibus, D.D., asked leave to absent himself from all
scholastic acts for a fortnight in order to visit his friends who were
sick<a name='fna_350' id='fna_350' href='#f_350'><small>[350]</small></a>. Friar William Walle was dispensed from fifteen days of his
regency in 1518<a name='fna_351' id='fna_351' href='#f_351'><small>[351]</small></a>; Friar John Brown from his regency during Lent in
1514<a name='fna_352' id='fna_352' href='#f_352'><small>[352]</small></a>. Gilbert Sander and Walter Goodfeld were released from the whole
of their necessary regency<a name='fna_353' id='fna_353' href='#f_353'><small>[353]</small></a>. John Smyth obtained a similar grace as
being ‘warden of a convent and consequently very busy<a name='fna_354' id='fna_354' href='#f_354'><small>[354]</small></a>.’ Dispensations
from the sermon which was to be preached in St. Mary’s within a year of
inception were also very frequent<a name='fna_355' id='fna_355' href='#f_355'><small>[355]</small></a>.</p>

<p>These and other graces were usually granted subject to certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>conditions. The recipient was often to say masses ‘for the pestilence’ or
‘for the welfare of the Regents’<a name='fna_356' id='fna_356' href='#f_356'><small>[356]</small></a>: or he had to lecture gratuitously
on some specified book<a name='fna_357' id='fna_357' href='#f_357'><small>[357]</small></a> or preach a sermon<a name='fna_358' id='fna_358' href='#f_358'><small>[358]</small></a>; or again the payment
of a sum of money was imposed as a condition<a name='fna_359' id='fna_359' href='#f_359'><small>[359]</small></a>. Thus in 1515 Friar John
Flavyngur was allowed to give extraordinary lectures on a book of the
Decretals,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘on condition that he would pay 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to the University on the
day of his admission and would read two books of the Decretals<a name='fna_360' id='fna_360' href='#f_360'><small>[360]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Friar Thomas Frances received permission in 1521 to incept</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘on condition that he would pay 40<i>d.</i> within a month for the repair
of the staff of the junior bedell of arts and would preach a sermon at
St. Paul’s within two years and an examinatory sermon before his
degree<a name='fna_361' id='fna_361' href='#f_361'><small>[361]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Franciscan students were maintained at the Universities by a system of
exhibitions. These were provided sometimes by private benefactors<a name='fna_362' id='fna_362' href='#f_362'><small>[362]</small></a>,
usually by the native convent of the student out of the ‘common alms,’
with the occasional assistance of other convents<a name='fna_363' id='fna_363' href='#f_363'><small>[363]</small></a>. From the few traces
which remain of the custom we may infer that the exhibition was generally
reckoned at £5 a year, and that this sum covered the ordinary expenses of
living<a name='fna_364' id='fna_364' href='#f_364'><small>[364]</small></a>. Masters, lecturers and bachelors, as already stated, were
supported by the convent in which they lectured<a name='fna_365' id='fna_365' href='#f_365'><small>[365]</small></a>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> but their allowance
was probably not much larger than that of the ordinary student friars.
Nicholas Hereford, preaching at Oxford in 1382<a name='fna_366' id='fna_366' href='#f_366'><small>[366]</small></a>, asserted that those
of the Mendicants who had graduated as masters or bachelors, in addition
to the ample allowance which they got from their community, begged for
themselves, saying, ‘I am a bachelor (or master) and require more than
others, because I ought to be able to live up to my position.’ (<i>Quia
oportet me habere ad expendendum secundum statum meum.</i>)</p>

<p>It is impossible to say what proportion of the Franciscans at Oxford
proceeded to a degree. In 1300 we have the names of twenty-two members of
the convent: of these, ten at least were then, or became afterwards,
Doctors of Divinity<a name='fna_367' id='fna_367' href='#f_367'><small>[367]</small></a>. But the proportion of graduates to non-graduates
and B.D.’s in the whole convent cannot have been nearly so large. The
following statistics are derived from the University Registers<a name='fna_368' id='fna_368' href='#f_368'><small>[368]</small></a>. From
1449 to 1463, five Franciscans obtained or supplicated for the doctor’s
degree; five others for that of bachelor only. From 1505 to 1538 (i.e.
about thirty-three years, as some pages of the Registers are missing),
twenty-five Franciscans incepted or supplicated for the degree of D.D.;
twenty-six others obtained or supplicated for that of B.D. (one of them
also for B.Can.L.): three more were admitted to oppose: one more
supplicated for B.Can.L. The proportion of D.D.’s to B.D.’s would
generally be larger than this: from 1532 to the dissolution in 1538
fourteen obtained, or supplicated for, the degree of bachelor, two only
became D.D.’s: we may reasonably suppose that some of the fifteen
bachelors would have proceeded to the doctor’s degree had not the
dissolution intervened.</p>

<p>The following figures will show the relative numbers of the various

<p class="title">BOOKS AND LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>It is difficult to realise the external conditions under which the friars
produced their works. At the end of the thirteenth and in the early part
of the fourteenth century&mdash;the period of their greatest literary
activity&mdash;privacy must have been almost unknown. Only ministers and
lectors at the Universities were allowed to have a separate chamber or
compartment shut off from the dormitory<a name='fna_371' id='fna_371' href='#f_371'><small>[371]</small></a>. But there can be little
doubt that, from Wiclif’s time onwards<a name='fna_372' id='fna_372' href='#f_372'><small>[372]</small></a>, each Doctor of Divinity had
his chamber; and every student had some place allotted to him, in which
stood a <i>studium</i>, or combined desk and book-case<a name='fna_373' id='fna_373' href='#f_373'><small>[373]</small></a>. Every student
friar had books set apart for his especial use<a name='fna_374' id='fna_374' href='#f_374'><small>[374]</small></a>; these books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> were
obtained by gift or bequest<a name='fna_375' id='fna_375' href='#f_375'><small>[375]</small></a>, by purchase<a name='fna_376' id='fna_376' href='#f_376'><small>[376]</small></a> or by assignation by
the Provincial<a name='fna_377' id='fna_377' href='#f_377'><small>[377]</small></a> or Warden<a name='fna_378' id='fna_378' href='#f_378'><small>[378]</small></a>, or they had been copied out by the
friar himself<a name='fna_379' id='fna_379' href='#f_379'><small>[379]</small></a>. Alexander IV expressly declared that they were not the
private property of the individual friars<a name='fna_380' id='fna_380' href='#f_380'><small>[380]</small></a>; on the death of the friar
who had had the use of them, they reverted to the convent, or were

distributed to others ‘by the Warden with the consent of the convent and
licence of the minister<a name='fna_381' id='fna_381' href='#f_381'><small>[381]</small></a>.’</p>

<p>There is no reason to suppose that the friars had a chamber specially set
apart as a <i>scriptorium</i>; they were comparatively free from the legal
routine or ‘office-work’ which the administration of their vast estates
imposed on the monks and their clerks. But the transcription of
manuscripts was part of the regular work of the Oxford Franciscans; and it
is indeed the only kind of manual labour expressly mentioned in connexion
with the convent. Roger Bacon’s statement<a name='fna_382' id='fna_382' href='#f_382'><small>[382]</small></a> that he could only get a
fair copy of his works made for the Pope by writers unconnected with his
Order, means merely that there were no professional scribes among the
Minorites of Paris.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> The vellum which Adam Marsh asked the Custodian of
Cambridge to send at his earliest convenience<a name='fna_383' id='fna_383' href='#f_383'><small>[383]</small></a>, may have been intended
for original compositions of the friars, but it was probably to be used
for a careful fair copy of some work&mdash;perhaps a Missal or a book of the
Bible. Several manuscripts, containing the works of Nicholas Gorham, are
still extant, which Friar William of Nottingham copied at Oxford with
‘tedious solicitude’ and ‘laborious diligence,’ at the expense of his
brother, Sir Hugh of Nottingham<a name='fna_384' id='fna_384' href='#f_384'><small>[384]</small></a>.</p>

<p>It was naturally in the libraries that most of the literary treasures were
stored. In the fifteenth century there were two libraries in the
Franciscan convent at Oxford, the library of the convent and the library
of the student friars<a name='fna_385' id='fna_385' href='#f_385'><small>[385]</small></a>. There is no evidence that either was founded
by Grostete<a name='fna_386' id='fna_386' href='#f_386'><small>[386]</small></a>. The convent probably received its first considerable
collection of books from Adam Marsh, to whom his uncle, Richard Marsh,
Bishop of Durham, bequeathed his library in 1226<a name='fna_387' id='fna_387' href='#f_387'><small>[387]</small></a>. The next book we
hear of at the Grey Friars is the volume of Decretals purchased by
Agnellus<a name='fna_388' id='fna_388' href='#f_388'><small>[388]</small></a>&mdash;doubtless the <i>Decretum</i> of Gratian with the additions
codified by Raymund of Pennaforte and approved by Gregory IX in 1230. In
1253, Grostete,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘because of his love for Friar Adam Marsh, left in his will all his
books to the convent of Friars Minors at Oxford<a name='fna_389' id='fna_389' href='#f_389'><small>[389]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>From a rather obscure passage in one of Adam’s letters<a name='fna_390' id='fna_390' href='#f_390'><small>[390]</small></a>, this would
appear to mean all Grostete’s writings ‘both original and translated,’ not
all the books which he possessed: on the other hand, a copy of St.
Augustine’s <i>De Civitate Dei</i> is extant which the friars received from
Grostete<a name='fna_391' id='fna_391' href='#f_391'><small>[391]</small></a>. These works of <i>Lincolniensis</i> were in the library in the
middle of the fifteenth century, when Dr. Thomas Gascoigne was allowed to
consult them<a name='fna_392' id='fna_392' href='#f_392'><small>[392]</small></a>. He mentions particularly having seen a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> complete copy
of Grostete’s letters<a name='fna_393' id='fna_393' href='#f_393'><small>[393]</small></a>, his autograph gloss or exposition on the
Epistles of St. Paul<a name='fna_394' id='fna_394' href='#f_394'><small>[394]</small></a>, two copies (one of them autograph) of his
commentary on the Psalter<a name='fna_395' id='fna_395' href='#f_395'><small>[395]</small></a>, a treatise against
luxury<a name='fna_396' id='fna_396' href='#f_396'><small>[396]</small></a>, and
another <i>super textum</i><a name='fna_397' id='fna_397' href='#f_397'><small>[397]</small></a>, both written by his own hand. Boston of Bury
notices his translation of the <i>Testamenta XII Patriarcharum</i> in the same
place. Friar Thomas Netter of Walden refers to a book <i>De Studio</i> by
Grostete, with autograph notes by the author, which he had seen in the
Minorite convent<a name='fna_398' id='fna_398' href='#f_398'><small>[398]</small></a>; and Wadding mentions two more treatises, or rather
sermons, which Grostete gave to the friars&mdash;one <i>De Laude Paupertatis</i>,
the other <i>De Scala Paupertatis</i><a name='fna_399' id='fna_399' href='#f_399'><small>[399]</small></a>. Probably all these were in the
library of the convent<a name='fna_400' id='fna_400' href='#f_400'><small>[400]</small></a>. Another relic of Grostete preserved there was
his ‘episcopal sandals made of rushes<a name='fna_401' id='fna_401' href='#f_401'><small>[401]</small></a>.’</p>

<p>The statement that all Roger Bacon’s works were in these libraries rests
on the authority of John Twyne<a name='fna_402' id='fna_402' href='#f_402'><small>[402]</small></a>, but it is not probable that his
writings were ever collected in one place. No doubt the works of the
scholastic philosophers, and chiefly of the Franciscan schoolmen<a name='fna_403' id='fna_403' href='#f_403'><small>[403]</small></a>,
formed the bulk of the library; which also contained a bibliographical
compilation of considerable value, namely the <i>Catalogus illustrium
Franciscanorum</i>, of which Leland often makes use<a name='fna_404' id='fna_404' href='#f_404'><small>[404]</small></a>. St. Jerome’s
‘Catalogue of Illustrious Men,’ was there bound up with ‘many other good
books<a name='fna_405' id='fna_405' href='#f_405'><small>[405]</small></a>,’ his commentaries on Isaiah and
Ezechiel<a name='fna_406' id='fna_406' href='#f_406'><small>[406]</small></a>, a book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> called
<i>Speculum Laicorum</i><a name='fna_407' id='fna_407' href='#f_407'><small>[407]</small></a>, and a few Hebrew and even Greek
manuscripts<a name='fna_408' id='fna_408' href='#f_408'><small>[408]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Few only of the MSS. seem to have been preserved; very few at any rate can
be identified<a name='fna_409' id='fna_409' href='#f_409'><small>[409]</small></a>. Caius College possesses two of them, a copy of the
Gospels in Greek and a Psalter in Greek<a name='fna_410' id='fna_410' href='#f_410'><small>[410]</small></a>. The volume (already referred
to) containing St. Augustine’s <i>De Civitate Dei</i>, with Grostete’s
annotations, is now in the Bodleian<a name='fna_411' id='fna_411' href='#f_411'><small>[411]</small></a>. A thirteenth-century MS. of some
of Grostete’s lesser works, with St. Augustine’s <i>De Concordia quatuor
Evangeliorum</i>, given to Lincoln College by Gascoigne, was perhaps obtained
by him from the Franciscan library<a name='fna_412' id='fna_412' href='#f_412'><small>[412]</small></a>. The copy of Jerome’s ‘Catalogue
of Illustrious Men,’ which Gascoigne saw in this library, appears to be
extant among the MSS. in Lambeth Palace<a name='fna_413' id='fna_413' href='#f_413'><small>[413]</small></a>. It may be reasonably
conjectured that the single copy of Adam Marsh’s letters<a name='fna_414' id='fna_414' href='#f_414'><small>[414]</small></a>, and some or
all of the treatises bound up in Phillipps MS. 3119<a name='fna_415' id='fna_415' href='#f_415'><small>[415]</small></a>, were also kept,
or at any rate written, in the Oxford <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>convent. The following interesting
notes occur in a Digby manuscript in the Bodleian<a name='fna_416' id='fna_416' href='#f_416'><small>[416]</small></a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘For the information of those wishing to know the principles of the
musical art, this book, which is called <i>Quatuor principalia Musice</i>,
was given by Friar John of Tewkesbury to the Community of the Friars
Minors at Oxford, with the authority and assent of Friar Thomas of
Kyngusbury, Master, Minister of England, namely <span class="smcaplc">A. D.</span> 1388. So that it
may not be alienated by the aforesaid community of friars, under pain
of sacrilege.’... (At the end), ‘This work was first finished on the
4th of August, 1351. In that year the Regent among the Minors at
Oxford was Friar Symon of Tunstede, D.S.T., who excelled in music and
in the seven liberal arts. Here ends the treatise called <i>Quatuor
principalia</i>, which was put forth by a Friar Minor of the custody of
Bristol, who did not insert his name here because some thought scorn
of him’ (<i>propter aliquorum dedignacionem</i>).</p></div>

<p>Sometimes, if we may believe their accusers, the Friars obtained books by
less creditable means than gift, bequest, or purchase. In 1330<a name='fna_417' id='fna_417' href='#f_417'><small>[417]</small></a> the
Sheriff of Oxfordshire received a writ from the King instructing him</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘to command the Warden of the Friars Minors at Oxford and friar Walter
de Chatton to give back to John de Penreth, clerk, justly and without
delay, two books of the value of forty shillings, which they are
unjustly keeping, as he says’;</p></div>

<p>failing this the said friars shall be summoned to appear before the King’s
justices at Westminster. The Sheriff forwarded this writ to the Mayor, but
the latter declared that the friars were not subject to his jurisdiction,
‘and therefore nothing was done in the matter<a name='fna_418' id='fna_418' href='#f_418'><small>[418]</small></a>.’</p>

<p>The friars had on all sides the reputation of being great collectors of
books. Richard Fitzralph, the famous Archbishop of Armagh, was fond of
exaggeration<a name='fna_419' id='fna_419' href='#f_419'><small>[419]</small></a>, and no one will accept without considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
modifications his statement, made before the Pope in 1257<a name='fna_420' id='fna_420' href='#f_420'><small>[420]</small></a>, that the
friars have grown so numerous and wealthy,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘that in the faculties of Arts, Theology, Canon Law, and as many
assert, Medicine and Civil Law, scarcely a useful book is to be found
in the market, but all are bought up by the friars, so that in every
convent is a great and noble library, and every one of them who has a
recognised position in the Universities (and such are now innumerable)
has also a noble library.’</p></div>

<p>Some rectors of churches, whom the Archbishop had sent to the
Universities, had even been obliged to return home owing to the
impossibility of getting Bibles and other theological books. Perhaps these
rectors were not filled with a passionate desire to learn. In 1373 the
University passed a statute against the excessive number of unauthorized
booksellers in Oxford<a name='fna_421' id='fna_421' href='#f_421'><small>[421]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Richard of Bury mentions the great help he received from Dominicans and
Franciscans in collecting his books<a name='fna_422' id='fna_422' href='#f_422'><small>[422]</small></a>, and bears testimony to the
magnificence of the libraries of the Mendicants which he visited:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘there we found heaped up amid the utmost poverty the utmost riches of
wisdom<a name='fna_423' id='fna_423' href='#f_423'><small>[423]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>But Richard of Bury notices a tendency among the ‘religious’ to
subordinate the love of books to</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the threefold superfluous care of the belly, clothes, and
houses<a name='fna_424' id='fna_424' href='#f_424'><small>[424]</small></a>,’</p></div>

<p>and the tendency became much stronger after his time. The almost<a name='fna_425' id='fna_425' href='#f_425'><small>[425]</small></a>
total absence of books in the bequests to the Oxford Franciscans in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is the more striking because of the
frequency of such bequests to colleges. It is said that the Minorites sold
many of their books to Dr. Thomas Gascoigne<a name='fna_426' id='fna_426' href='#f_426'><small>[426]</small></a>. Certain it is that in
the latter days they parted with them, just as ‘forcyd by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> necessitie,’
they parted with their jewels and plate<a name='fna_427' id='fna_427' href='#f_427'><small>[427]</small></a>. The exclusion of the
Mendicant Friars from the use of the University Library by the statutes of
1412<a name='fna_428' id='fna_428' href='#f_428'><small>[428]</small></a>, cannot have been any real hardship to the Franciscans so long
as their own library was intact. In the sixteenth century however this was
no longer the case, and we accordingly find some instances of Franciscans
supplicating for admission to the library of the University<a name='fna_429' id='fna_429' href='#f_429'><small>[429]</small></a>. The
earliest instance is in 1507; but, as the registers from 1463 to 1505 are
lost, it would of course be ridiculous to attempt to draw from this fact
any inference as to the date of the dispersion of the books of the
Minorites. Leland visited the Friary shortly before the Dissolution, and
we have from his pen the last description of the once famous
library<a name='fna_430' id='fna_430' href='#f_430'><small>[430]</small></a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘At the Franciscans’ house there are cobwebs in the library, and moths
and bookworms; more than this&mdash;whatever others may boast&mdash;nothing, if
you have regard to learned books. For I, in spite of the opposition of
all the friars, carefully examined all the bookcases of the library.’</p></div>

<p class="title">PLACE OF OXFORD IN THE FRANCISCAN ORGANIZATION.</p>

<div class="note"><p class="hang">Learned friars as practical workers among the people.&mdash;Their
sermons.&mdash;Educational organization throughout the country.&mdash;Relations
of the Oxford School to the Franciscan Schools of Europe.&mdash;English
Franciscans teach at foreign Universities.&mdash;Oxford as the head of a
<i>custodia</i>.&mdash;Provincial chapters held at Oxford.</p></div>


<p>If the Franciscans became leaders of scholastic thought, they were first
and foremost practical workers. ‘Unfitted as the works of Roger Bacon or
of Raymond Lully might seem to the practical divine, it was for him, not
for the philosophic disputant, whether as a missionary among the Saracens
or a combatant of error and heresy at home, that these works were
written<a name='fna_431' id='fna_431' href='#f_431'><small>[431]</small></a>.’ In the case of Roger Bacon this is abundantly evident.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Before all,’ he writes<a name='fna_432' id='fna_432' href='#f_432'><small>[432]</small></a>, ‘the utility of everything must be
considered; for this utility is the end for which the thing exists....
The utility of philosophy is in its bearing on theology and the church
and state and the conversion of infidels and the reprobation of those
who cannot be converted<a name='fna_433' id='fna_433' href='#f_433'><small>[433]</small></a>.... The end of all sciences, and their
mistress and queen,’ is moral philosophy, ‘for this alone teaches the
good of the soul<a name='fna_434' id='fna_434' href='#f_434'><small>[434]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>It is difficult to resist the temptation of quoting more passages of this
kind<a name='fna_435' id='fna_435' href='#f_435'><small>[435]</small></a> (illustrating as they do the Franciscan view of life),
especially as, in the dearth of records, actual instances are hard to
find: one proof however may be brought that it was not all theory. Among
the twenty-two Oxford Minorites, for whom in the year 1300 the Provincial,
Hugh of Hertepol, claimed the episcopal licence to hear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> confessions
of the crowds who thronged to the church of St. Francis, eight were then
or afterwards doctors of divinity and theological lecturers to the Friars
at Oxford, and among the others were two names of yet greater fame, Robert
Cowton and John Duns Scotus<a name='fna_436' id='fna_436' href='#f_436'><small>[436]</small></a>. It must however be added that, of the
eight friars who were actually licensed by the bishop to hear confessions,
none appears as having subsequently lectured or taken a degree<a name='fna_437' id='fna_437' href='#f_437'><small>[437]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Here however we may see how the Franciscans brought their philosophy to
the test of experience in the details of everyday life; and they possessed
to a remarkable degree, in spite of&mdash;perhaps because of&mdash;their learning,
the power of appealing to the hearts of the people.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘It is the first step in wisdom,’ said Roger Bacon, ‘to have regard to
the persons to whom one speaks<a name='fna_438' id='fna_438' href='#f_438'><small>[438]</small></a>,’</p></div>

<p>and his brethren followed this principle in their preaching. ‘Their
sermons,’ says Brewer, ‘are full of pithy stories and racy anecdotes; now
introducing some popular tradition or legend, now enforcing a moral by
some fable or allegory<a name='fna_439' id='fna_439' href='#f_439'><small>[439]</small></a>.’ It has often occasioned surprise that the
generation which saw the rise of poetry in England, saw also the rise of
English prose&mdash;that, in a word, Wiclif was the contemporary of Chaucer.
When we remember that, for a century and a half, men versed in all the
learning of their time had been constantly preaching to the people in the
vulgar tongue in every part of the country, we shall see less cause to
wonder at the vigorous language, the clear and direct expression, of ‘the
father of English prose.’</p>

<p>For the learning of the friars was not confined to the Universities<a name='fna_440' id='fna_440' href='#f_440'><small>[440]</small></a>.
To the Franciscans Oxford was more than a place for study; it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
centre of a great educational organization which extended throughout the
land.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘The gift of wisdom,’ to quote Eccleston’s words, ‘so overflowed in
the English province, that before the deposition of Friar William of
Nottingham, there were thirty lecturers in England who solemnly
disputed, and three or four who lectured without disputation. For he
had assigned in the Universities students for each convent, to succeed
to the lecturers on their death or removal<a name='fna_441' id='fna_441' href='#f_441'><small>[441]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>However, in practice this rule was not very strictly adhered to. Sometimes
a friar would pursue his studies with a view to becoming reader to a
particular convent<a name='fna_442' id='fna_442' href='#f_442'><small>[442]</small></a>; but usually, when an ‘extra-university’
lectureship was founded or fell vacant, the convent applied to the
Provincial Minister for any lecturer they chose<a name='fna_443' id='fna_443' href='#f_443'><small>[443]</small></a>. Thus about the year
1250, the brethren at Norwich requested that Friar Eustace of Normanville
should be appointed as their lecturer<a name='fna_444' id='fna_444' href='#f_444'><small>[444]</small></a>. Eustace, after consulting Adam
Marsh, declined the office with the Minister’s permission, alleging in
excuse his weak health and his want of the necessary training and
experience; and Adam informed Robert de Thornham, custodian of the
Cambridge ‘Custody,’ in which Norwich was situated, of the decision<a name='fna_445' id='fna_445' href='#f_445'><small>[445]</small></a>.
The appointments, like those of the Oxford lecturers, were in the hands of
the Provincial Chapter, and the various convents obtained letters of
recommendation from powerful patrons in support of their candidate<a name='fna_446' id='fna_446' href='#f_446'><small>[446]</small></a>.
The lecturer was appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> for one year, and could be re-elected by the
Provincial Chapter at the request of the convent<a name='fna_447' id='fna_447' href='#f_447'><small>[447]</small></a>. Nor was it only to
brethren of their own Order that the friars were sent. For many years a
Franciscan was theological lecturer to the monks of Christchurch,
Canterbury, till at length in 1314 one of his pupils was able to take his
place. His teaching, wrote the monks, in grateful recollection of their
‘lector,’</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘in urbe redolet Cantuarie, ac plures nostre congregacionis fratres
ipsius sedulos auditores ita sacre scripture aspersione intima
fecundavit, quod ipsos ad lectoris officium in scolis nostris
subeundum ydoneos reputamus; nos unum de fratribus et commonachis
nostris predictis loco dicti fratris Roberti ad hujusmodi ministerium
exequendum duximus subrogare<a name='fna_448' id='fna_448' href='#f_448'><small>[448]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Thus the friars disseminated over the country, from the universities
outwards, the ‘New Learning’ of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>But the fame of the Franciscan school at Oxford was not only English, but
European<a name='fna_449' id='fna_449' href='#f_449'><small>[449]</small></a>. Friars were sent thither to study not only from
Scotland<a name='fna_450' id='fna_450' href='#f_450'><small>[450]</small></a> and Ireland<a name='fna_451' id='fna_451' href='#f_451'><small>[451]</small></a>, but from France and Aquitaine<a name='fna_452' id='fna_452' href='#f_452'><small>[452]</small></a>,
Italy<a name='fna_453' id='fna_453' href='#f_453'><small>[453]</small></a>, Spain<a name='fna_454' id='fna_454' href='#f_454'><small>[454]</small></a>, Portugal<a name='fna_455' id='fna_455' href='#f_455'><small>[455]</small></a>, and Germany<a name='fna_456' id='fna_456' href='#f_456'><small>[456]</small></a>; while many of the
Franciscan schools on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> the Continent, both in universities and
elsewhere<a name='fna_457' id='fna_457' href='#f_457'><small>[457]</small></a>, drew their teachers from England, and, in England, mainly
from Oxford. Eccleston mentions a friar who studied with him at Oxford,
where his lectures, after some failures, won the admiration of Grostete;
afterwards, as his fame increased, he was called by the Minister-General
to Lombardy, and enjoyed a great reputation even at the Papal court<a name='fna_458' id='fna_458' href='#f_458'><small>[458]</small></a>.
Grostete, on his return from the Council of Lyons, was anxious to get Adam
Marsh out of the neighbourhood of Paris as soon as possible.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘It is not safe,’ he writes to the Provincial Minister, ‘to let Adam
stay there; for many greatly desire to keep him at Paris, especially
now that Alexander of Hales and John de Rupellis are dead; and so both
you and I shall be deprived of our greatest comfort<a name='fna_459' id='fna_459' href='#f_459'><small>[459]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>At another time<a name='fna_460' id='fna_460' href='#f_460'><small>[460]</small></a> the General writes to the Provincial Minister of
England, requesting him to send English friars to Paris to teach; it was
probably on this occasion that Richard of Cornwall<a name='fna_461' id='fna_461' href='#f_461'><small>[461]</small></a> left Oxford to win
the applause of his hearers at Paris. Peckham received his early education
in the schools of his Order at Oxford, and lectured at Paris and at the
Court of Rome<a name='fna_462' id='fna_462' href='#f_462'><small>[462]</small></a>. Among those whom the Oxford Convent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> sent to teach in
the universities of the Continent, were John Wallensis, William of
Gainsborough, Roger Bacon, Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham<a name='fna_463' id='fna_463' href='#f_463'><small>[463]</small></a>. All
these names belong to the thirteenth or early fourteenth century; from
that time onwards international jealousies and wars rendered the connexion
of the English universities with Paris far less close, and contemporaneous
with this breach was the beginning of the intellectual decline of the
Order of St. Francis.</p>

<p>Oxford was the head of a ‘custody,’ which contained, according to the list
given by Bartholomew of Pisa<a name='fna_464' id='fna_464' href='#f_464'><small>[464]</small></a>, seven other convents, namely, Reading,
Bedford, Stamford (Linc.), Nottingham, Northampton, Leicester, and
Grantham. What exactly the organization of a ‘<i>custodia</i>’ was, it is
impossible to determine; it was probably always rather indefinite, and
Bartholomew of Pisa points out that in early records the word is used very
loosely<a name='fna_465' id='fna_465' href='#f_465'><small>[465]</small></a>. Perhaps it was originally intended to hold chapters of
custodies<a name='fna_466' id='fna_466' href='#f_466'><small>[466]</small></a>, as well as of provinces and convents. The Custodian had in
early years the right of making and enforcing byelaws in his custody; thus</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘in the custody of Oxford at the head of which Friar Peter was for
twelve years, the brethren did not use pillows up to the time of Friar
Albert the minister<a name='fna_467' id='fna_467' href='#f_467'><small>[467]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Each custody had its special characteristic, Oxford being chiefly
remarkable for study<a name='fna_468' id='fna_468' href='#f_468'><small>[468]</small></a>. Two Custodians of Oxford, Peter of Tewkesbury
and John of Stamford, became Provincial Ministers<a name='fna_469' id='fna_469' href='#f_469'><small>[469]</small></a>. At first the
Wardens of the convents were appointed by the Custodian<a name='fna_470' id='fna_470' href='#f_470'><small>[470]</small></a>, but in 1240
the right of election was transferred to the convents themselves, and many
friars at the same time demanded the total abolition of the Custodian’s
office, on the ground that it was superfluous<a name='fna_471' id='fna_471' href='#f_471'><small>[471]</small></a>. It continued however,
to exist down to the Dissolution and seems to have implied a general right
of supervision; the Custodian was a kind of permanent <i>visitator</i><a name='fna_472' id='fna_472' href='#f_472'><small>[472]</small></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>Several Provincial Chapters were held at Oxford. It was probably a
Conventual, not a Provincial Chapter, before which Grostete, then ‘reading
the act at the Friars Minors,’ preached his sermon in praise of poverty
and mendicancy<a name='fna_473' id='fna_473' href='#f_473'><small>[473]</small></a>. Here Albert of Pisa held his first chapter as
Provincial Minister of England, and announced the stern principles which
were to guide his government<a name='fna_474' id='fna_474' href='#f_474'><small>[474]</small></a>. Soon after this Elias instituted a
severe visitation throughout the Order, and sent Friar Wygmund or Wygred,
a German, as visitor to England in 1237 or 1238<a name='fna_475' id='fna_475' href='#f_475'><small>[475]</small></a>. He held chapters at
London, Southampton, Gloucester, and Oxford<a name='fna_476' id='fna_476' href='#f_476'><small>[476]</small></a>. At the latter place the
Warden, Friar Eustace de Merc, was bitterly attacked and excluded a day
and a half from the chapter, though his innocence seems to have been
eventually established<a name='fna_477' id='fna_477' href='#f_477'><small>[477]</small></a>. The inquisitorial methods adopted by the
visitor raised a storm of opposition throughout the province, which found
expression, on the completion of the visitation, in a Provincial Chapter
held at Oxford in the summer or autumn of 1238<a name='fna_478' id='fna_478' href='#f_478'><small>[478]</small></a>. Here a solemn appeal
to Rome was formulated, and exemption claimed from all visitations, except
those authorized by the General Chapter<a name='fna_479' id='fna_479' href='#f_479'><small>[479]</small></a>. The result of this and
similar appeals from the Order was the final deposition of Elias by the
Pope on the 15th of May, 1239<a name='fna_480' id='fna_480' href='#f_480'><small>[480]</small></a>.</p>

<p>In the spring or early summer of 1248 the Minister-General, John of Parma,
held a Provincial Chapter at Oxford,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘in which he confirmed the provincial constitutions concerning poverty
in living and buildings (<i>de parsimonia et paupertate aedificiorum</i>).
And when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> gave the friars the option of confirming or deposing the
Provincial Minister (W. of Nottingham), they unanimously asked that he
might be confirmed<a name='fna_481' id='fna_481' href='#f_481'><small>[481]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Eccleston states that in the same chapter the Minister-General</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘recalled the brethren to unity who had begun to surpass the rest in
singular opinions<a name='fna_482' id='fna_482' href='#f_482'><small>[482]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>For this chapter the King provided one cask of wine and the necessaries of
life<a name='fna_483' id='fna_483' href='#f_483'><small>[483]</small></a>. In 1289 three of the four Orders celebrated their Provincial
Chapters at Oxford, that of the Minorites taking place on the feast of the
Nativity of the Virgin (Sept. 8)<a name='fna_484' id='fna_484' href='#f_484'><small>[484]</small></a>. No account of the proceedings
remains.</p>

<p>The next Provincial Chapter at Oxford about which we have any information
was held in 1405, at a critical period in the history of the Order in
England. In 1404 ‘a great and very scandalous schism’ arose among the
Franciscans owing to the arbitrary and unconstitutional conduct of the
Provincial, John Zouch<a name='fna_485' id='fna_485' href='#f_485'><small>[485]</small></a>. The friars appealed to the Protector of the
Order, the Cardinal-bishop of Sabina, who appointed Friars Nicholas
Fakenham and John Mallaert commissioners, with power to depose the
Provincial, if necessary. The commissioners deposed him in his absence,
called a chapter at Oxford on May 3rd<a name='fna_486' id='fna_486' href='#f_486'><small>[486]</small></a>, and proceeded to elect a
successor. The Vicar of the Provincial forbade the friars to attend the
chapter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘And the commissioners prayed the King to order the friars to assemble

at the chapter at Oxford for the reformation of their religion; and
they obtained royal briefs about this matter<a name='fna_487' id='fna_487' href='#f_487'><small>[487]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>John Zouche was afterwards reinstated by the Protector of the Order, but
does not seem to have ever made good his authority over the English
Province<a name='fna_488' id='fna_488' href='#f_488'><small>[488]</small></a>.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that a spirit of rivalry should exist between the two
great Mendicant Orders; and the rivalry soon developed into antagonism. In
the thirteenth century one lecturer to the Friars Minors at Oxford was
removed from the convent, another was suspended from lecturing, for
causing offence to the Friars Preachers and at their request<a name='fna_489' id='fna_489' href='#f_489'><small>[489]</small></a>. An
‘enormous scandal of discord,’ in Matthew Paris’ words<a name='fna_490' id='fna_490' href='#f_490'><small>[490]</small></a>, arose in the
year 1243, each of the two Orders claiming precedence of the other. Though
there is little direct evidence on the point, there is no doubt that
Oxford was one of the chief scenes of conflict. The controversy was
carried on by ‘men of education and scholars<a name='fna_491' id='fna_491' href='#f_491'><small>[491]</small></a>,’ and some details of it
are preserved in the pages of Eccleston. It arose from the proselytising
tendencies of the two Orders<a name='fna_492' id='fna_492' href='#f_492'><small>[492]</small></a>. The Dominicans, according to
Eccleston<a name='fna_493' id='fna_493' href='#f_493'><small>[493]</small></a>,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>‘were wont to profess on the day of their entry,
if they liked, as did Friar R. Bacun<a name='fna_494' id='fna_494' href='#f_494'><small>[494]</small></a> of good memory.’</p></div>

<p>Friar Albert of Pisa, when Provincial Minister of England, obtained a bull
from Gregory IX prohibiting this practice:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the Friars Preachers were not to bind anyone so as to prevent him
entering any Order he chose, nor were the friars to admit their
novices to profession till the year of probation had been
completed<a name='fna_495' id='fna_495' href='#f_495'><small>[495]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The Dominicans on their side claimed similar privileges, and obtained a
bull from Innocent IV to the effect that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘no Friar Minor should receive those bound to them (<i>suos obligatos</i>);
if he did so, he should be excommunicated <i>de facto</i>; and they
consented to the same privilege about those bound to us.’</p></div>

<p>Eccleston complains that the Dominicans made such good use of the bull
that ‘they let scarcely any one go;’ and regards this equitable
arrangement as a great hardship to his Order. ‘But not long,’ he adds,
‘did this tribulation last;’ Friars William of Nottingham and Peter of
Tewkesbury obtained from Innocent IV a revocation of his
constitution<a name='fna_496' id='fna_496' href='#f_496'><small>[496]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The antagonism between the two Orders did not stop here, and in many of
the great questions of the day they are found on opposite sides. The
Oxford Franciscans, as we have already seen, were among the staunchest
supporters of Simon de Montfort; the Oxford Dominicans seem to have sided
with the King. The famous Mad Parliament, which Henry III summoned to
Oxford in 1258, met in the convent of the Black Friars, and Prince Edward
and his retainers stayed there before the battle of Lewes<a name='fna_497' id='fna_497' href='#f_497'><small>[497]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The same rivalry made itself felt in the sphere of philosophy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> the
Franciscans dealt a heavy blow at their more orthodox adversaries by
impugning successfully an important doctrine of Thomas Aquinas<a name='fna_498' id='fna_498' href='#f_498'><small>[498]</small></a>. The
Angelic Doctor had held with Aristotle and against Averroes that the
individualising principle was not form but matter. How then, asked his
opponents, could the individual exist in the non-material world<a name='fna_499' id='fna_499' href='#f_499'><small>[499]</small></a>? Such
a doctrine was in contradiction to the mediaeval theory of heaven and the
life after death; and the Church rallied to the side of the Franciscans.
At Oxford, Archbishop Kilwardby, Dominican though he was, condemned this
among many other errors in 1276, but the sentence seems to have had little
effect at the time<a name='fna_500' id='fna_500' href='#f_500'><small>[500]</small></a>. It was chiefly against this opinion that
Peckham’s measures in 1284 were directed<a name='fna_501' id='fna_501' href='#f_501'><small>[501]</small></a>. If the Dominicans had
allowed the aspersion cast on their greatest teacher to pass without
serious protest when the condemnation came from one of themselves, they
were anything but content to submit to the adverse judgment of one of
their rivals. Peckham was attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> both by the Provincial of the Black
Friars in a congregation at Oxford<a name='fna_502' id='fna_502' href='#f_502'><small>[502]</small></a> and in an anonymous pamphlet
apparently by a Cambridge Dominican<a name='fna_503' id='fna_503' href='#f_503'><small>[503]</small></a>&mdash;‘a cursed page and infamous
leaf,’ as he describes it, ‘whose beginning is headless, whose middle
malignant, and whose end foolish and formless.’ His action further
involved the whole of the Franciscan Order in England in the storm. He was
accused of ‘having sown discord between the Orders<a name='fna_504' id='fna_504' href='#f_504'><small>[504]</small></a>;’ and to defend
himself against the charge of unduly favouring the Franciscans, he denied
that he had consulted the latter on the subject and insisted on the
previous condemnation of the same error by his predecessor<a name='fna_505' id='fna_505' href='#f_505'><small>[505]</small></a>. He
claimed to be actuated by no personal animus against the dead, whom he
held in high honour and whom he had himself defended; his attack was
directed against ignorant and arrogant men who presumed to teach what they
did not know and to entice youths to the same errors. ‘We cannot and dare
not,’ he urged, ‘fail to rescue our children, as far as we can, from the
traps of error;’ and he forbade ‘curious theologians’ to defend the
condemned doctrines in ‘the disputes of boys’ (<i>in certaminibus
puerilibus</i>) at Oxford.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘We by no means,’ he adds, ‘reprobate the studies of philosophers, so
far as they serve the mysteries of theology, but the profane novelties
which, contrary to philosophic truth, have been introduced into the
heights of theology in the last twenty years, to the injuries of the
saints.’</p></div>

<p>The question became a matter rather of feeling than of argument; the
<i>esprit de corps</i> of the rival factions was involved, and the two Orders
further estranged<a name='fna_506' id='fna_506' href='#f_506'><small>[506]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Peckham lost few opportunities of advancing the interests of the
Mendicants at the expense of the monks and secular clergy, and of his
brother Franciscans against the other Orders. The discipline and morals of
the nuns of Godstow had suffered owing to the proximity of their house to
the university-town, and the Archbishop, in his injunctions for the better
government of the same, appointed two Friars Preachers and two Friars
Minors (or four of each if necessary) as permanent confessors to the
Convent<a name='fna_507' id='fna_507' href='#f_507'><small>[507]</small></a>. In 1291 he wrote to the Prior of St. Frideswide’s urging him
to confer the church of St. Peter le Bailey on some one devoted to the
Friars Minors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> nominated by them<a name='fna_508' id='fna_508' href='#f_508'><small>[508]</small></a>. While strenuously asserting the
right of the Minorites to hear confessions in spite of the opposition of
the parish priests<a name='fna_509' id='fna_509' href='#f_509'><small>[509]</small></a>, he forbade the Carmelites and Austin Friars at
Oxford to hear any confessions of any persons whatsoever, regular or
secular, clerk or lay, male or female, and ordered the Archdeacon, if they
disobeyed, to pronounce public sentence of excommunication on them<a name='fna_510' id='fna_510' href='#f_510'><small>[510]</small></a>.
Arguing that ‘it was lawful to change a vow for a better one<a name='fna_511' id='fna_511' href='#f_511'><small>[511]</small></a>,’ he
maintained that the Franciscans might, as they had hitherto done, admit
members of other religious bodies to their Order; he would, he wrote to
the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, himself admit them, if he were
still Provincial Minister.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘We have heard with great surprise,’ he proceeds, ‘that the Prior and
friars of the Order of St. Augustine in Oxford are imposing the mark
of excommunication on the Friars Minors of Oxford, and defaming them
in many ways, for receiving one of their friars in the aforesaid
canonical form. We therefore order you to go in person to the Austin
friary and warn them, in our name and by our authority, to cease from
these detractions. But if they assert that they have raised this
tumult against the Minorites on the ground of some privilege of
theirs, you shall ask them to let me have a copy of their privilege to
compare with those of the Minorites which we have to maintain; and we
will certainly not allow them to be molested in contravention of their
privilege; nor will we endure that the Friars Minors be injuriously
oppressed, for by so doing we should break the commands of the
Pope<a name='fna_512' id='fna_512' href='#f_512'><small>[512]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Peckham further, while condemning the erroneous opinions of the Dominicans
at Oxford, denied the claim to superiority which they put forward<a name='fna_513' id='fna_513' href='#f_513'><small>[513]</small></a>.
The Franciscans claimed precedence on the ground of their humility (which
of course dwindled in inverse ratio as their assertion of it grew), and of
their absolute poverty. The Archbishop enunciated the formula which was
condemned by the inquisitors and the Pope in the next century, and which
formed, so to speak, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> text of the controversy, ‘<i>De paupertate
Christi</i>.’ He defined the poverty of the apostles to be</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘having no title to the possession of any property real or personal,
private or common<a name='fna_514' id='fna_514' href='#f_514'><small>[514]</small></a>;’</p></div>

<p>the Minorites in following this example were in a state of ‘perfection,’
and lived a holier life than any other Order in the Church.</p>

<p>The claim was generally admitted, and led to the exaltation of the
Minorites in the eyes of the world at the expense of the other
Orders<a name='fna_515' id='fna_515' href='#f_515'><small>[515]</small></a>. As early as 1269 a controversy on this point arose between
the convents of the two Orders at Oxford. A Dominican named Solomon of
Ingeham accused the Minorites of receiving money either with their own
hands or through a third party<a name='fna_516' id='fna_516' href='#f_516'><small>[516]</small></a>. The Franciscans denied the charge and
demanded the punishment of Friar Solomon. The Dominicans asked them to
prove the falsehood of Solomon’s assertion and promised then to punish
him. ‘The burden of proof,’ replied the Franciscans, ‘lies with you who
affirm, not with us who deny.’ The Dominicans brought forward many
instances in which they maintained that the Minorites had actually
received money. These, answered the latter, were merely personal
transgressions, and affected the community no more than any case of carnal
sin or disobedience. The Dominicans, however, based their contention
mainly on the argument that money bequeathed to the Franciscans must be
received either by them in person or by intermediaries on their behalf.
The Minorites answered</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘that, according to the definition of lawyers, money left by will is
counted among the goods of the deceased until it passes into the
<i>dominium</i> and property of the legatee. But it cannot become ours by
legal right or pass into our <i>dominium</i> without our consent. Thus
money, howsoever it may be deposited by the executors or committed to
anyone for the brethren, is always counted among the goods of the
deceased as long as it remains unspent, and the executors can, by
their own authority or by that of the deceased, reclaim it at
pleasure. How then can it be called ours?’</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>Peace was eventually restored by the interposition of the Chancellor and
leading secular masters, at whose recommendation Friar Solomon withdrew
his words. It is curious that neither the document containing the account
of this quarrel, nor Peckham, mention the explanation which afterwards
became the accepted theory, that the ownership of the goods of the
Franciscans was vested in the Pope. Yet this explanation was originally
given by Innocent IV in 1245<a name='fna_517' id='fna_517' href='#f_517'><small>[517]</small></a>.</p>

<p>As far as the bulk of the Franciscan Order was concerned, the controversy
on ‘Evangelical Poverty’ was purely a theoretical one<a name='fna_518' id='fna_518' href='#f_518'><small>[518]</small></a>, its ultimate
importance rather accidental than real. The claim to ‘this perfitnesse,’
as Daw Topias contemptuously calls it, rested not on fact but on a legal
construction. The friars had only the use, not the proprietorship, of
their lands and houses and goods. John XXII by his bull, ‘<i>Ad conditorem
canonum</i>,’ issued on the 8th of December, 1322, and declaring that use was
inseparable from proprietorship, withdrew from the Order the right of
holding property in the name of the Roman See, and thus went far to
destroy its theoretical claim to precedence. The whole Order, instead of
the party of the <i>Spirituales</i> merely, was for a time banded against the
Pope; and the dispute about a legal quibble became transformed under the
hands of Ockham into an examination of the position and claims of the
Papacy, and of the whole relation of Church and State.</p>

<p>Ockham probably studied at Oxford in his younger days, but it was no doubt
later in life, and under the influence of Marsilius of Padua, that he
developed the doctrines which made him ‘at once the glory and the reproach
of his Order<a name='fna_519' id='fna_519' href='#f_519'><small>[519]</small></a>.’ In philosophy he had many followers at Oxford in the
fourteenth century, and the Franciscan Convent was, like the rest of the
University, divided on the questions of Nominalism and Realism<a name='fna_520' id='fna_520' href='#f_520'><small>[520]</small></a>. The
dispute concerning the poverty of Christ was not allowed to rest. It was
this discussion which first brought the Archbishop of Armagh into open
hostility to the friars<a name='fna_521' id='fna_521' href='#f_521'><small>[521]</small></a>; and Wiclif <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>mentions the controversy as
being still carried on between the two Orders in his time.</p>

<p>A great historian has said of the Middle Ages, that ‘at no time in the
world’s history has theory, pretending all the while to control practice,
been so utterly divorced from it<a name='fna_523' id='fna_523' href='#f_523'><small>[523]</small></a>.’ An extract from the Patent
Rolls<a name='fna_524' id='fna_524' href='#f_524'><small>[524]</small></a> will afford a striking illustration of the truth of these words
as far as the learned Franciscans, the professors of evangelical poverty,
are concerned. The date is February 22nd, 1378; the writ is issued in the
King’s name.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Know that whereas certain horses, cups, books, money, silver vessels,
and diverse other goods and chattels, which belonged to our beloved

London by one Thomas Bele his servant and other evil doers, ... we
have of our special favour granted to the said John all the horses,
cups, books, money, vessels and other goods and chattels aforesaid,
wheresoever they may be,’ &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>It was probably the glaring contrast between the lofty claims of the
friars and their actual life, rather than any inferiority in their
morality as compared with the secular priests, which exposed them to the
bitterest denunciations and taunts of the reformers. The Mendicants were
far more in sympathy with the poor than were the endowed monks, and
possessed far more than the parish priests the confidence of the
people<a name='fna_525' id='fna_525' href='#f_525'><small>[525]</small></a>. Wiclif recognised this fact, while he lamented it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>‘Though it raine on the Awter of the Parish Church, the blind people
is so deceived, that they will rather give to waste houses of Friars,
then to Parish Churches, or to common waies, though men cattle and
beasts ben perished therein<a name='fna_526' id='fna_526' href='#f_526'><small>[526]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The first important attack on the friars in the fourteenth century was
that led by Richard Fitzralph, Archbishop of Armagh. He had been Fellow of
Balliol College before 1325 and Chancellor of the University in 1333<a name='fna_527' id='fna_527' href='#f_527'><small>[527]</small></a>.
While assailing the whole principle of mendicancy, his main charge against
the friars, especially the friars at Oxford, was that of ‘stealing’
children, i.e. of secretly inducing them to enter the Mendicant Orders.
In 1357 the Archbishop was cited to appear and defend himself before the
Papal Court at Avignon; and on the 8th of November, in a solemn assembly
of Pope and Cardinals, he made a great speech in defence of the parish
priests against the Mendicants<a name='fna_528' id='fna_528' href='#f_528'><small>[528]</small></a>. The Archbishop stated that, owing to
the privileges of hearing confessions which the friars enjoyed, almost all
youths in the Universities, and in the houses of their parents (in nearly
all of which friars were to be found as ‘<i>familiares</i>’), had Mendicants as
their confessors.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Enticed by the wiles of the friars and by little presents<a name='fna_529' id='fna_529' href='#f_529'><small>[529]</small></a>, these
boys (for the friars cannot circumvent men of mature age) enter the
Orders, nor are they afterwards allowed, according to report, to get
their liberty by leaving the Order, but they are kept with them
against their will until they make profession; further, they are not
permitted, as it is said, to speak with their father or mother, except
under the supervision and fear of a friar; an instance came to my
knowledge this very day; as I came out of my inn an honest man from
England, who has come to this court to obtain a remedy, told me that
immediately after last Easter, the friars at the University of Oxford
abducted in this manner his son who was not yet thirteen years old,
and when he went there, he could not speak with him except under the
supervision of a friar.’</p></div>

<p>Parents were in consequence afraid to send their sons to the Universities,
and preferred to keep them at home as tillers of the soil. While the
numbers both of the friaries and of their inmates had enormously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
increased, the number of secular students in every faculty decreased; the
students at Oxford, who in his time were reckoned at 30,000, had now sunk
to 6000.</p>

<p>Though these figures are of course preposterously exaggerated, and though
the main cause of the diminution of the number of students was the Black
Death, there can be no doubt of the essential truth of the accusation. In
1358 the University of Oxford passed a statute forbidding the admission of
boys under eighteen to the Orders. The statute deserves to be quoted at
length<a name='fna_530' id='fna_530' href='#f_530'><small>[530]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘It is generally reported and proved by experience, that the nobles of
this realm, those of good birth, and very many of the common people,
are afraid, and therefore cease, to send their sons or relatives or
others dear to them in tender youth, when they would make most advance
in primitive sciences, to the University to be instructed, lest any
friars of the Order of Mendicants should entice or induce such
children, before they have reached years of discretion, to enter the
Order of the same Mendicants; and because owing to the admission of
such boys to the Mendicant Orders, the tranquillity of the students of
the University has been often disturbed; therefore the said
University, zealous in the bowels of piety both for the number of her
sons and the quiet of her students, has ordained and decreed, that if
any of the Order of Mendicants shall receive to their habit in this
University, or induce, or cause to be received or induced, any such
youth before the completion of his eighteenth year at least, or shall
send such an one away from the University or cause him to be sent
away, in order that he may be received into the same Order elsewhere:
then <i>eo ipso</i> no one of the cloister or community of such a friar,
... being a graduate, shall during the year immediately following,
read or attend lectures in this University or elsewhere where such
exercises would count as discharge of the statutable requirements in
this University (<i>vel alibi quod in hac Vniversitate pro forma aliqua
sibi cedat</i>); and this penalty shall be inflicted on all those of the
Order of Mendicants, and the associates of all those, who shall be
convicted by credible persons of having withdrawn youths in any way
from the University, or from hearing philosophy.’</p></div>

<p>The friars did not deny the charge, but defended their conduct<a name='fna_531' id='fna_531' href='#f_531'><small>[531]</small></a>, and
exerted themselves to the utmost to obtain a repeal of the statute. Their
efforts were successful. While a suit which they had begun in the Roman
Court was yet undecided, the Provincials of the four Orders laid their
grievances before the King in Parliament<a name='fna_532' id='fna_532' href='#f_532'><small>[532]</small></a>. In 1366 the obnoxious
statute was formally annulled, on condition that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> friars’ suits at
Rome and elsewhere against the University should cease<a name='fna_533' id='fna_533' href='#f_533'><small>[533]</small></a>. The latter,
however, did not abandon the struggle; its influence is probably to be
seen in the petition of the Commons in 1402<a name='fna_534' id='fna_534' href='#f_534'><small>[534]</small></a>, that no one be allowed
to enter any of the four Orders under the age of twenty-one years. The
King’s answer was not favourable: he ordained merely that no friar should
admit to his Order an infant under fourteen years without the assent of
his father, mother, or guardians. The ordinance applied to the whole of
England, and the petition of the Commons is a sign that the popularity of
the friars had suffered under the attacks of Wiclif.</p>

<p>It has been clearly shown by recent criticism<a name='fna_535' id='fna_535' href='#f_535'><small>[535]</small></a> that Wiclif’s enmity to
the friars was confined to the last few years of his life. His earlier
opponents were the monks&mdash;the <i>religiosi possessionati</i>. At one time he
compares the poverty and mendicancy of St. Francis with the manual labour
of St. Peter and St. Paul, in contrast with the possessions and worldly
honours of the ecclesiastics of his time<a name='fna_536' id='fna_536' href='#f_536'><small>[536]</small></a>. He seems to have been on
terms of some intimacy with William Woodford, who may be regarded as the
leader of the Oxford Minorites in their subsequent controversy with the
reformer and his followers. Woodford relates<a name='fna_537' id='fna_537' href='#f_537'><small>[537]</small></a> that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘when I was lecturing concurrently with him on the Sentences<a name='fna_538' id='fna_538' href='#f_538'><small>[538]</small></a> ...
Wiclif used to write his answers to the arguments, which I advanced to
him, in a notebook which I sent him with my arguments, and to send me
back the notebook.’</p></div>

<p>Wiclif had indeed many points of sympathy, especially on questions of
ecclesiastical polity, with the Friars Minors. He was in agreement with
them and in antagonism to the monks and many of the bishops, in the
opinion that the tribute to the Pope should be refused, and that the
secular power was, under some circumstances, justified in depriving the
Church of its possessions<a name='fna_539' id='fna_539' href='#f_539'><small>[539]</small></a>. Eight or nine years before Wiclif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> wrote
his famous tract in defence of the Parliament of 1366, an Oxford friar and
doctor declared in his school that the King had the right of depriving
ecclesiastics of their temporalities; he was ordered by Congregation to
recant this and other opinions solemnly after a University sermon, and to
pay 100<i>s.</i> to the University<a name='fna_540' id='fna_540' href='#f_540'><small>[540]</small></a>.</p>

<p>When, however, Wiclif began to call in question the Church’s doctrine on
the Eucharist, he found himself in direct antagonism to the friars; and
the quarrel, which began in a dogmatic difference in the schools<a name='fna_541' id='fna_541' href='#f_541'><small>[541]</small></a>,
soon acquired a wider character. Wiclif’s accusations resolve themselves
really into three<a name='fna_542' id='fna_542' href='#f_542'><small>[542]</small></a>; firstly, that the friars upheld the ‘idolatrous’
doctrine of the Eucharist; secondly, that they maintained the theory of
the mendicancy of Christ; thirdly, that they taught the people to rely for
their salvation on letters of fraternity and prayers and masses, instead
of on a good life; whence a general demoralization ensued.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>‘Popis graunten no pardoun to men bot if þei be byfore verrely
contritte, bot þese freris in hor lettres speken of no
contricioun<a name='fna_543' id='fna_543' href='#f_543'><small>[543]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>It is improbable, however, that the indulgences granted by the friars
differed from the other indulgences of the Middle Ages, which in theory
absolved from the temporal punishment, not from the sin and eternal
punishment. Wiclif may have classed with the friars the ‘pardoners’ who
did not belong to any of the four Orders<a name='fna_544' id='fna_544' href='#f_544'><small>[544]</small></a>. The records relating to the
Franciscan house at Oxford throw no light on the matter, which indeed
belongs to the general history of the Mendicants, not to the history of a
particular convent. Wiclif’s charges amount practically to this: the
friars were the foremost champions of the external, unspiritual form of
religion, which he laboured to destroy: they were no longer leaders of
thought, but obstacles to progress.</p>

<p>Though Wiclif’s writings, especially his English writings, are full of
violent invective against the friars<a name='fna_545' id='fna_545' href='#f_545'><small>[545]</small></a>, it is difficult to find in them
any definite accusations of the grosser forms of immorality. One instance
will sufficiently illustrate the difference between Wiclif and his
followers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Friars also,’ says the former, ‘be foully envenomed with ghostly sin
of Sodom, and so be more cursed than the bodily Sodomites that were
suddenly dead by hard vengeance of God; for they do ghostly lechery by
God’s word, when they preach more their own findings for worldly muck,
than Christ’s Gospel for saving of men’s souls<a name='fna_546' id='fna_546' href='#f_546'><small>[546]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>‘Jack Upland’ improves on this, and does not scruple to impute to the
friars generally the vilest sins.</p>

<p class="poem">‘Your freres ben taken alle day<br />
with wymmen and wifes,<br />
bot of your privey sodomye<br />
spake I not yette<a name='fna_547' id='fna_547' href='#f_547'><small>[547]</small></a>.’</p>

<p>At Oxford the seculars, always numerically strong and jealous of the
regulars, rallied to Wiclif’s standard; while the Mendicants roused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> the
anger of the University by appealing to external authority. The friars
were accused of having made use of their position as confessors to stir up
the peasant revolt. On the 18th of February, 1382, the heads of the four
Mendicant Convents at Oxford sent a letter to John of Gaunt, denying the
charge and begging his protection<a name='fna_548' id='fna_548' href='#f_548'><small>[548]</small></a>; all evils were attributed to them,
and their lives were in danger. Their chief enemy was Nicholas Hereford.
In Lent of the same year Hereford preached a University sermon at St.
Mary’s, in which he argued that no ‘religious’ should be admitted to any
degree at Oxford<a name='fna_549' id='fna_549' href='#f_549'><small>[549]</small></a>. He was appointed by the Chancellor to deliver the
principal English sermon of the year at St. Frideswide’s Cross on
Ascension Day (May 15th), and used the opportunity to attack monks and
friars and mendicancy in general<a name='fna_550' id='fna_550' href='#f_550'><small>[550]</small></a>. On the 19th of the same month, the
‘Council of the Earthquake’ met at the Blackfriars in London, and
condemned ten of Wiclif’s conclusions as heretical and fourteen as
erroneous; among the seventeen doctors of divinity who took part in the
council were four Minorites, the Oxford Franciscans being represented by
Hugo Karlelle and Thomas Bernewell<a name='fna_551' id='fna_551' href='#f_551'><small>[551]</small></a>. The Archbishop sent Peter Stokes,
a Carmelite, to publish the condemnation at Oxford. The Chancellor and
Proctors resented this interference with their rights, and the general
feeling was strong in Wiclif’s favour. Stokes and his brethren went in
fear of their lives; when the Carmelite ‘determined’ against Philip
Repyngdon on the 10th of June, men were seen in the schools with arms
concealed under their clothes. At length, on June 15th, the Chancellor was
compelled, by the King’s command, to publish the condemnation of the
twenty-four conclusions;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘and he thus so roused the seculars against the religious that many of
the latter feared death, the seculars crying out that they wanted to
destroy <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>the University, though really they (the religious) only
defended the cause of the Church<a name='fna_552' id='fna_552' href='#f_552'><small>[552]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>In November the University tried to turn the tables on its adversaries; in
an assembly of the clerks at St. Frideswide’s, the Chancellor accused some
of the orthodox party (among them a Minorite friar) of heresy<a name='fna_553' id='fna_553' href='#f_553'><small>[553]</small></a>. But
from this time the sacramental controversy tended to retire into the
background, and the alliance of monks and friars, which Wiclif’s attack on
the faith had called into being<a name='fna_554' id='fna_554' href='#f_554'><small>[554]</small></a>, came to an end. In 1392, Henry
Crompe, a Cistercian monk, who had been a prominent opponent of Wiclif,
was charged with having determined on several occasions against the right
of the friars to hear confessions<a name='fna_555' id='fna_555' href='#f_555'><small>[555]</small></a>. Friar John Tyssyngton and other
Minorites took part in his condemnation in a Convocation held in the house
of the Carmelites at Stamford. In their anxiety to silence their
adversaries, the Mendicant Orders proved false to the tradition common to
all the great mediaeval Universities&mdash;the tradition of intellectual
freedom; they upheld the claim of Archbishop Arundel to visit the
University, and lent their support to the rigid censorship which he
established<a name='fna_556' id='fna_556' href='#f_556'><small>[556]</small></a>. But it is only fair to remember that, years before this,
the authority of the Church had been invoked against the teaching of the
friars themselves. In 1368 Simon Langham sent thirty errors of the friars
to the University, and it was enacted that no one should presume to defend
or approve these tenets in the schools or elsewhere ‘on pain of the
greater excommunication<a name='fna_557' id='fna_557' href='#f_557'><small>[557]</small></a>.’</p>

<p>The history of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries affords many other
illustrations of the hostility with which the friars, and especially the
Minorites, were regarded by the University. The subject of academical
degrees, and of the action taken by the University against the
‘wax-doctors,’ has been treated elsewhere. A statute, which probably dates
from the first half of the fifteenth century, provides that both the
<i>collatores</i> of University sermons shall, if possible, be seculars<a name='fna_558' id='fna_558' href='#f_558'><small>[558]</small></a>.
Wood says that in the years 1423 and 1424 there</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘were nothing but heartburnings in the University occasioned by the
Friers their preaching up and down against tithes.’</p></div>

<p>The chief offender, Friar William Russell, warden of the Greyfriars of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
London, taught that tithes might be given arbitrarily, i.e. not to the
parson legally entitled to them, but ‘for the pious use of the poor,’
according to the will of the giver. The University of Oxford condemned
this doctrine and ordained that everyone taking a degree should formally
abjure it: the oath, which remained in force till 1564, runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Insuper</i>, tu jurabis quod nullas conclusiones per fratrem Wilhelmum
Russell, ordinis Minorum, nuper positas et praedicatas, contra decimas
personales, et in nostra Universitate Oxoniae, necnon in venerabili
concilio episcoporum, anno Domini millesimo quadringentesimo vicesimo
quinto celebrato Londoniis, solemniter damnatas, nec alicujus earum
sententiam tenebis, docebis, vel defendes efficaciter publice aut
occulte, nec aliquem doctorem, tentorem vel defensorem hujusmodi, ope,
consilio vel favore juvabis<a name='fna_559' id='fna_559' href='#f_559'><small>[559]</small></a>.</p></div>

<p>For a similar offence another Franciscan, William Melton, D.D., was
arrested at the instance of the University, and compelled to recant<a name='fna_560' id='fna_560' href='#f_560'><small>[560]</small></a>.
The Alma Mater kept a vigilant eye on her sons wherever they might be. In
1482 Friar Isaac Cusack, D.D., began to create disturbances in Ireland by
preaching the old Franciscan doctrine of evangelical poverty; he was
captured, sent to Oxford, and degraded and expelled the University as a
vagabond and a heretic<a name='fna_561' id='fna_561' href='#f_561'><small>[561]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The feeling of nationality fostered by the long French wars was not
without its influence on the friars in England and especially at the
Universities. In 1369 the Chancellor caused a royal proclamation to be
published at Carfax ordering all French students at Oxford, both religious
and secular, to leave the kingdom<a name='fna_562' id='fna_562' href='#f_562'><small>[562]</small></a>. In 1388 a royal writ was issued to
the Warden of the Friars Minors in Oxford at the advice of the same
convent, warning him to admit no foreign friars who might reveal to the
enemy ‘the secrets and counsel of our kingdom,’ and to expel any such
friars for whose good behaviour he would not be responsible, or who would
not pray or celebrate masses for the King and the good estate of the
realm<a name='fna_563' id='fna_563' href='#f_563'><small>[563]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Among the many problems presented by the reign of Richard II, not the
least obscure is the passionate loyalty with which the Franciscans
regarded his memory<a name='fna_564' id='fna_564' href='#f_564'><small>[564]</small></a>. Yet Richard II and his councillors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> were
suspected of Lollardy, while his successor posed as the champion of
orthodoxy. Henry IV, however, derived his support chiefly from the wealthy
ecclesiastics, and the Lollardy of the Court of Richard II was rather
political than dogmatic; the opinions prevalent at the Court were more in
consonance with Wiclif’s earlier teaching and with the teaching of the
Franciscan Order on the need of poverty in the Church and the evils of its
endowments, than with the Lollard doctrine of the Eucharist. In the early
years of Henry IV the Franciscans were active in organizing
conspiracies<a name='fna_565' id='fna_565' href='#f_565'><small>[565]</small></a>; the pulpit and the confessional were used to spread
disaffection against the new monarch<a name='fna_566' id='fna_566' href='#f_566'><small>[566]</small></a>; and the failure of his
campaigns was attributed to the magical arts of the Friars Minors<a name='fna_567' id='fna_567' href='#f_567'><small>[567]</small></a>. In
1402, eight Minorites of the convent of Leicester were seized, and
convicted on their own admission of having organized an armed revolt to
find King Richard and restore him to the throne<a name='fna_568' id='fna_568' href='#f_568'><small>[568]</small></a>. They were condemned
to be hanged and decapitated at Tyburn, and the sentence was carried out
in the sight of many thousands without any ecclesiastical protest. One of
these friars was Roger Frisby, an old man and Master in Theology<a name='fna_569' id='fna_569' href='#f_569'><small>[569]</small></a>. On
the Vigil of the feast of St. John the Baptist<a name='fna_570' id='fna_570' href='#f_570'><small>[570]</small></a>&mdash;the very day on which
the rebels were to meet ‘in the plain of Oxford,’ his head was taken from
London Bridge and brought to Oxford;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘and in the presence of the procession of the University, the herald
proclaimed: “This Master Friar Minor of the convent of Leicester in
hypocrisy, adulation, and false life, preached often, saying that King
Richard is alive, and roused the people to seek him in Scotland;” and
his head was set on a stake there<a name='fna_571' id='fna_571' href='#f_571'><small>[571]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>While subject to attacks from without, the Franciscan Order suffered from
rival factions within. The long-standing division between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> the lax or
Conventual, and the strict or Observant parties, at length received formal
recognition in the Council of Constance (1415) when the Observants were
constituted a semi-independent branch under a Vicar-General<a name='fna_572' id='fna_572' href='#f_572'><small>[572]</small></a>. How did
this arrangement affect Oxford as a <i>studium generale</i>? The Observants as
a body produced few students; the reformed houses on the Continent
objected to send their brethren to Paris<a name='fna_573' id='fna_573' href='#f_573'><small>[573]</small></a>. A few foreign Observants
found their way to Oxford in the fifteenth century<a name='fna_574' id='fna_574' href='#f_574'><small>[574]</small></a>; and when later in
the century Observant friaries were founded in England<a name='fna_575' id='fna_575' href='#f_575'><small>[575]</small></a>, some of their
members studied in the Conventual house at the University<a name='fna_576' id='fna_576' href='#f_576'><small>[576]</small></a>. Whether
any part of the Convent was set apart for them is unknown: according to
all appearance, the brethren of both branches lived together in peace and
goodwill.</p>

<p>Of the internal economy of the Franciscan house at Oxford, or indeed of
any friary in England, little is known or ever can be known. The
<i>Registrum Fratrum Minorum Londoniae</i> is, in Brewer’s words, ‘the only
work of the kind extant. A painful proof, if such were needed, of the
utter devastation committed when the Franciscan convents were dissolved,
and their libraries dispersed<a name='fna_577' id='fna_577' href='#f_577'><small>[577]</small></a>.’ We may here give some account of the
records which must once have existed in every Franciscan house or
province. From the earliest times an annual <i>compotus</i><a name='fna_578' id='fna_578' href='#f_578'><small>[578]</small></a> or
balance-sheet of income and expenditure was drawn up, and if in later days
this was sometimes omitted, an ex-warden was always liable to be called to
render an account to his successor<a name='fna_579' id='fna_579' href='#f_579'><small>[579]</small></a>. In each convent would also be
kept a list of the brethren who died there<a name='fna_580' id='fna_580' href='#f_580'><small>[580]</small></a>; and lists both of living
benefactors and of dead, for whose souls prayers or masses were to be
said<a name='fna_581' id='fna_581' href='#f_581'><small>[581]</small></a>, while
many in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> lifetime received ‘letters of
confraternity<a name='fna_582' id='fna_582' href='#f_582'><small>[582]</small></a>.’ In the decrees of the General Chapter of Paris in
1292 it is commanded<a name='fna_583' id='fna_583' href='#f_583'><small>[583]</small></a> that each minister should have the lives and
acts of holy friars carefully collected in his province and entered in
special registers, and bring them to the General Chapter; also that all
notable excesses of friars, grave crimes, and credible accusations, the
sentences passed and punishments inflicted on the offenders, should be
noted in books kept for the purpose, preserved in the archives of the
province, and faithfully handed on to each succeeding minister. The acts
of Provincial Chapters were also kept<a name='fna_584' id='fna_584' href='#f_584'><small>[584]</small></a>. Of these and similar records
we have, besides the London register already alluded to, only a few
letters of fraternity<a name='fna_585' id='fna_585' href='#f_585'><small>[585]</small></a>. Of English Franciscan records originated by or
relating to the convent at Oxford, not one (unless the list of lectors and
the account of the controversy with the Dominicans in 1269<a name='fna_586' id='fna_586' href='#f_586'><small>[586]</small></a> can be
called records) is known to exist<a name='fna_587' id='fna_587' href='#f_587'><small>[587]</small></a>. Any account, therefore, of the
internal life of the convent must be meagre and unsatisfactory in the
highest degree.</p>

<p>The hours and numbers of daily services seem to have differed little, if
at all, from those observed in other monastic institutions<a name='fna_588' id='fna_588' href='#f_588'><small>[588]</small></a>. We may
therefore omit this subject and treat of the points which receive
additional elucidation from documents relating to Oxford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>The first means of livelihood of the Mendicant Friars was naturally
begging. Certain of the brethren were appointed by the Warden to ‘procure’
food for the convent during some fixed period<a name='fna_589' id='fna_589' href='#f_589'><small>[589]</small></a>. There were no definite
rules as to how many friars should be sent as ‘procuratores’ or
‘limitors’<a name='fna_590' id='fna_590' href='#f_590'><small>[590]</small></a>; the details depended on the necessities of the convent
and the will of the Superior<a name='fna_591' id='fna_591' href='#f_591'><small>[591]</small></a>. Each house had definite ‘limits’
assigned to it, within which its members might beg<a name='fna_592' id='fna_592' href='#f_592'><small>[592]</small></a>. The friars went
two and two, accompanied by a servant or boy<a name='fna_593' id='fna_593' href='#f_593'><small>[593]</small></a> who carried the
offerings, which were usually in kind. The friar in Chaucer’s ‘Sompnoure’s
Tale,’ himself a ‘maister<a name='fna_594' id='fna_594' href='#f_594'><small>[594]</small></a>’ in the schools, after preaching in the
church went round the village&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">‘In every hous he gan to pore and prye<br />
And beggyd mele or chese, or ellis corn<a name='fna_595' id='fna_595' href='#f_595'><small>[595]</small></a>.’</p>

<p>A good deal of private begging was done by the student friars to obtain
the means of study<a name='fna_596' id='fna_596' href='#f_596'><small>[596]</small></a>. Roger Bacon appealed to his brother in England,
to his powerful and wealthy acquaintances, for money to carry out the
commands of the Pope<a name='fna_597' id='fna_597' href='#f_597'><small>[597]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘But how often (he writes to the latter) I was looked upon as a
dishonest beggar, how often I was repulsed, how often put off with
empty hopes, what confusion I suffered within myself, I cannot express
to you. Even my friends did not believe me, as I could not explain the
matter to them; so I could not proceed in this way. Reduced
(angustiatus) to the last extremities, I compelled my poor
friends<a name='fna_598' id='fna_598' href='#f_598'><small>[598]</small></a> to contribute all that they had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> and to sell many things
and to pawn the rest, often at usury, and I promised them that I would
send to you all the details of the expenses and would faithfully
procure full payment at your hands. And yet owing to their poverty I
frequently abandoned the work, frequently I gave it up in despair and
forbore to proceed.’</p></div>

<p>Begging of this kind would either be unauthorized or legalized by special
license. The statutes of the Order<a name='fna_599' id='fna_599' href='#f_599'><small>[599]</small></a> enact that every convent shall
have its ‘procurator’ or ‘syndicus,’ who shall transact all the legal
business of the house and receive in the name of the Roman Church for the
use of the friars all pecuniary alms and bequests, or all such alms and
bequests as can be changed into money. The express object of these
constitutions was to</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘preserve the Order in its purity and prevent the brethren being
immersed in secular affairs<a name='fna_600' id='fna_600' href='#f_600'><small>[600]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>It would appear that at Oxford in the fourteenth century the office of
alms-collector was held by one of the brethren. This conclusion, however
contrary to the spirit and letter of the statutes, seems warranted by a
remarkable legal document of the year 1341<a name='fna_601' id='fna_601' href='#f_601'><small>[601]</small></a>. It is the record of a
suit in the Hustings Court, in which Friar John of Ochampton, Warden of
the Friars Minors at Oxford, ‘through Friar John de Hentham his attorney,’
charged ‘Richard de Whitchford minor<a name='fna_602' id='fna_602' href='#f_602'><small>[602]</small></a>,’ with refusing to render an
account of the sums received by him when he was ‘receiver of pence of the
said warden,’ and with embezzling sixty shillings or more, which he
obtained from various people on the Monday after the feast of St. Michael,
1340. Two of the sums are specified, namely, one mark by the hands of
Richard, servant of John de Couton, and 12<i>s.</i> by the hands of Thomas of
London. The Warden claimed to have suffered loss to the extent of one
hundred shillings; Richard de Whitchford could not deny the receipt of the
money, but on his request the court appointed two auditors, Richard Cary
and John le Peyntour; to these he rendered an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> account, and was found to
be sixty shillings in arrears; ‘and,’ the record continues, ‘as he cannot
make satisfaction he is committed to prison.’</p>

<p>In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the Oxford friars sometimes
employed laymen to represent them in the courts<a name='fna_603' id='fna_603' href='#f_603'><small>[603]</small></a>; sometimes the Warden
appeared in person<a name='fna_604' id='fna_604' href='#f_604'><small>[604]</small></a>, but most of the legal business in the
Chancellor’s court at Oxford was undertaken by one of the brethren. From
1507 or before, to the Dissolution, this duty was entrusted to Friar Brian
Sandon. His name does not occur in the University Register, and he was,
though a priest<a name='fna_605' id='fna_605' href='#f_605'><small>[605]</small></a>, probably not a student; indeed, his administrative
business would hardly have left him time for other occupations. Between
1507 and 1516 and between 1527 and 1534, he appears as plaintiff or
defendant in some fifteen suits in the Chancellor’s court<a name='fna_606' id='fna_606' href='#f_606'><small>[606]</small></a>. Some of
these afford glimpses into the life of the friars. On the 26th of March,
1512<a name='fna_607' id='fna_607' href='#f_607'><small>[607]</small></a>, Father Brian instituted an action against John Morys, his
proctor, alleging that the latter</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘did not according to the convention before entered into between the
said friar and John Morys, bring corn to the house of the friars
minors;’</p></div>

<p>and on April 5th John Morys was committed to prison ‘at the instance of
the provost (<i>preposeti</i>) of the friars minors for a debt<a name='fna_608' id='fna_608' href='#f_608'><small>[608]</small></a>.’</p>

<p>But if the friars did not grow corn, they seem to have made use of their
meadows as pasture land. On the 20th of May, 1529<a name='fna_609' id='fna_609' href='#f_609'><small>[609]</small></a>, Friar Brian sued
Margery, widow of John Lock, for 7<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘for certain cheeses which the husband of the said Margery bought from
the aforesaid Brian Sanden.’</p></div>

<p>Eventually the case was submitted to the arbitration of William Clare the
elder, and Edmund Irishe, bailiffs of Oxford, with the addition of a third
if necessary, each party binding itself to abide by the decision of the
majority under penalty of 40<i>s.</i>, in case of disagreement, to be paid to
the party willing to accept the judgment.</p>

<p>While these and similar actions were instituted by Brian in fulfilment of
the duties of his position, he was undoubtedly engaged in others of a
private nature. At one time he acts as attorney for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> priest<a name='fna_610' id='fna_610' href='#f_610'><small>[610]</small></a>. At
another he is charged with wrongfully keeping a knife, the property of
<i>dominus</i> Galfred Coper<a name='fna_611' id='fna_611' href='#f_611'><small>[611]</small></a>. In 1531<a name='fna_612' id='fna_612' href='#f_612'><small>[612]</small></a> he had a dispute with his
tailor and appealed to the law, alleging</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘that, whereas he had given to William Gos<a name='fna_613' id='fna_613' href='#f_613'><small>[613]</small></a>, tailor, three yards
and three quarters of woollen cloth to make him a habit, the said Gos
had purloined one quarter of a yard, and that in consequence his
clothes were too short (<i>nimis brevem et succinctam</i>).’</p></div>

<p>Brian having declared on oath that he had supplied the above-mentioned
amount of cloth, Gos promised to give him 14<i>d.</i> as satisfaction for the
missing quarter of a yard. But later in the day he again appeared and
charged the friar with perjury. After some more recriminations an
agreement was come to out of court, and we hear no more of the habit.</p>

<p>That his litigious spirit should sometimes have brought Friar Brian into
trouble we cannot wonder. Several times in the latter part of his career
he was in danger of ‘bodily injury;’ in 1532<a name='fna_614' id='fna_614' href='#f_614'><small>[614]</small></a> he made application to
have Robert Holder bound over to keep the peace, and in 1534 the judge
ordered that James Penerton should not be released from Bocardo till he
found sufficient sureties that he would not inflict bodily harm on Friar
Brian or his friends (<i>familiaribus</i>)<a name='fna_615' id='fna_615' href='#f_615'><small>[615]</small></a>. The same year he complained of
having been libelled by one Giles Mawket, a carpenter (<i>fabro lignario</i>),
in the parish of St. Ebbe’s<a name='fna_616' id='fna_616' href='#f_616'><small>[616]</small></a>. This was probably a slander on his
character, which was not above suspicion. In 1535<a name='fna_617' id='fna_617' href='#f_617'><small>[617]</small></a> ‘a woman of Radley
named Anna’ asserted in the Commissary’s court that she was with child by
Thomas Denson, Bachelor of Laws:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘qui Denson (as the record puts it, reciting the evidence of Joanna
Cowper, another woman of ill-fame) egre tulit ut extraneus quisque
familiaritate dicte Anne uteretur; because (it is added in the margin)
he tok fryer Bryan wrastelyng w<sup>th</sup> her in a morning<a name='fna_618' id='fna_618' href='#f_618'><small>[618]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The records of the Chancellor’s court contain charges of immorality
against two other Friars Minors<a name='fna_619' id='fna_619' href='#f_619'><small>[619]</small></a>. The first was ‘<i>dompnus</i>’ Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Beste<a name='fna_620' id='fna_620' href='#f_620'><small>[620]</small></a>, who was summoned before the court together with a scholar of
Broadgates Hall,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘on grave suspicion of incontinence and disturbance of the peace.’
‘Then the judge commanded ‘<i>dompnus</i>’ Beste to go to the prison house,
namely le Bocardo, and remain there for half-an-hour’&mdash;</p></div>

<p>apparently while his case was considered. It does not appear what the
charge against him was, or what (if any) further steps were taken<a name='fna_621' id='fna_621' href='#f_621'><small>[621]</small></a>.
His companion was warned to moderate his attentions to the same Joanna,
wife of William Cooper or Cowper, of St. Ebbe’s, who appeared in the trial
above referred to.</p>

<p>Joanna seems to have taken a special interest in the Minorites. At the end
of 1533<a name='fna_622' id='fna_622' href='#f_622'><small>[622]</small></a> Friar Arthur, B.D., appealed to the court to stop her
spreading evil reports against him, which she had failed to prove; she was
ordered to abstain in future</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘from defaming the said friar or any of his house on pain of a fine of
40<i>s.</i> to be paid to the Convent of friars minors, and banishment from
the town; also that she shall not in any way lay traps (<i>paret ...
insidias</i>) for the said Arthur or any of his Order or cause such traps
to be laid, under the aforesaid penalties.’</p></div>

<p>But if Friar Arthur was innocent, he was peculiarly unfortunate. A few
months later<a name='fna_623' id='fna_623' href='#f_623'><small>[623]</small></a> he again appealed for protection against the libels of
Nicholas Andrews and John Poker, scholars of Peckwater’s Inn. At this time
Dr. Baskerfeld, Warden of the Grey Friars, was acting as substitute for
the Commissary, and he heard the case in the house of the Minorites. The
accusation has been carefully obliterated in the Chancellor’s book,
evidently by the friars themselves, but the gist of it can be deciphered.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Judex interrogavit eosdem an voluissent prefatum Arcturum accusare et
denunciare: qui responderunt se nolle<a name='fna_624' id='fna_624' href='#f_624'><small>[624]</small></a> hoc facere ...; a quibus
judex petiit ... an aliquid scandalosum et d ... scirent contra dictum
fratrem, et interrogavit eos quid hoc erat: et dicebant ambo hiis
verbis sequentibus (tactis evangeliis); ... they saw the seyde frere
Arctur in a chambre at the sygne of the Bere in all hollows parische
in Oxoford with a woman in a red capp ... both locked together in a
chambre, and seid to the mayd of the hous, “then ba ... why ... suche
ale here to be kept? It is not thy masters will and thy mistres that
ony suche ale shold be kept here.”’</p></div>

<p>Friar Arthur strenuously denied the accusation, and the court adjourned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
for two hours. When it reassembled, the defendants refused to submit to
Dr. Baskerfeld’s jurisdiction, arguing that he was incompetent to decide a
case in which one of the members of his convent was so deeply implicated.
Two days later, however, they confessed before the judge that they would
not swear to their original statement, and both sides promised to forgive
and forget the whole matter.</p>

<p>Though none of these charges was actually proved, we must admit that they
show that the convent was not in a healthy state on the eve of the
Dissolution. There is certainly no trace of the religious fervour by which
even in the latter days some of the Observant convents were honourably
distinguished. We find the brethren at Oxford engaged in money
transactions, lending<a name='fna_625' id='fna_625' href='#f_625'><small>[625]</small></a> and borrowing<a name='fna_626' id='fna_626' href='#f_626'><small>[626]</small></a>, ‘buying and selling<a name='fna_627' id='fna_627' href='#f_627'><small>[627]</small></a>.’
Friar John Arter<a name='fna_628' id='fna_628' href='#f_628'><small>[628]</small></a> kept a horse in the town and raised difficulties
about the bill; Randulph Craycoke or Cradoc, who had charge of the horse,
would not part with it till he had received ‘about ten shillings for food
and grass,’ which sum the friar refused to pay, asserting that Randulph
had worked the horse himself (<i>laboravit dictum equum diversis</i> (?)
<i>oneribus</i>). The court, to which the disputants appealed, reduced the
amount by 2<i>s.</i>; but Arter was probably unable to pay: no one appeared at
the time appointed to claim the animal, ‘so we sent Cradoc away with the
horse until his bill should be paid.’</p>

<p>The Warden, Friar Edward Baskerfeld, D.D., was plaintiff in a somewhat
similar case<a name='fna_629' id='fna_629' href='#f_629'><small>[629]</small></a>, in which both sides were represented by counsel. In his
evidence the friar deposed that he had lent Master Richard Weston, LL.B.,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘a Roane hors of the value of 20<i>s.</i> in the hostel de flore de
leust<a name='fna_630' id='fna_630' href='#f_630'><small>[630]</small></a>, and that he had handed over the horse to the servant of
the Subdean of Excestre in the name of Richard Weston, and that he
said these words, stroking (<i>palpando</i>) the belly of the horse: “how I
delyver the hors sane and sound without spurre gallyng I prey you
delyver hym so ageyn,” and that he never saw hym to this day.’</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>The parties agreed to submit the dispute to the judgment of three
arbitrators, and the result does not appear in the records of the court.</p>

<p>No doubt some of the friars had private incomes and emoluments of their
own<a name='fna_631' id='fna_631' href='#f_631'><small>[631]</small></a> (apart from the allowance or ‘exhibition’ which as students they
still received from their native convents or from benefactors); and some
may have lived outside the walls of their monastery<a name='fna_632' id='fna_632' href='#f_632'><small>[632]</small></a>. But the convent
itself was very poor; the love of many had waxed cold, and it was
inevitable that in order to get a livelihood they should resort to means
forbidden by their Rule.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the sixteenth century<a name='fna_633' id='fna_633' href='#f_633'><small>[633]</small></a>, the Warden, Dr. Goodefyld,
leased one of the gardens lying within the boundaries of the convent to
Richard Leke, brewer of Oxford. The terms of the agreement are unknown,
but the friars thought them&mdash;or Leke’s interpretation of them, very
injurious to their interests, and in 1513 and 1514 demanded the
repudiation of the contract. Feeling ran very high, and Leke was in
personal danger; the Warden was bound over to keep the peace, and promised</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘that if his friars molested Richard Leke, he would keep them in safe
custody until the matter had been more fully examined.’</p></div>

<p>Again the case was referred to arbitration and the decision is unknown. It
is interesting to find that Leke was fully reconciled to the friars before
his death<a name='fna_634' id='fna_634' href='#f_634'><small>[634]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The poverty of the brethren was aggravated by the irregularity with which
payments, on which they might justly reckon, were made. One of their chief
sources of income was a royal grant of 50 marcs per annum during the
King’s pleasure, to be paid in equal portions at Easter and Michaelmas. It
was first instituted by Edward I<a name='fna_635' id='fna_635' href='#f_635'><small>[635]</small></a> in 1289,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> and was continued by all
the kings (with the exception of Edward V) to the Dissolution<a name='fna_636' id='fna_636' href='#f_636'><small>[636]</small></a>.
Sometimes the sum was paid direct from the treasury; but often (and this
seems to have been the general custom as regards royal benefactions to
religious houses) a sheriff or other officer was held responsible for the
payment; either he was instructed to send the requisite amount to the
Exchequer, or he paid the money directly; and the sums which he paid were
accredited to him when he produced his accounts at the sessions of the
Exchequer. As may be proved by many instances, the system did not conduce
to regularity of payment. Edward II, in December 1313, ordered Richard
Kellawe, Bishop of Durham<a name='fna_637' id='fna_637' href='#f_637'><small>[637]</small></a>, ‘to send to our exchequer at Westminster
within fifteen days of the day of St. Hilary,’ ten marks in partial
satisfaction of the grant<a name='fna_638' id='fna_638' href='#f_638'><small>[638]</small></a>. But though this sum was to be the first
charge on the arrears in the Durham diocese of the tax of one-half of
their income<a name='fna_639' id='fna_639' href='#f_639'><small>[639]</small></a> imposed on the clergy by Edward I (<span class="smcaplc">A. D.</span> 1294), and
though writs were repeatedly<a name='fna_640' id='fna_640' href='#f_640'><small>[640]</small></a> issued to enforce payment, we find that
on the 4th of June, 1315, nothing had been done, ‘<i>unde vehementer
admiramur</i><a name='fna_641' id='fna_641' href='#f_641'><small>[641]</small></a>.’</p>

<p>The fifty marks were never made a definite fixed charge on the revenues of
any one county nor were they levied year by year as a single sum; each
year some sheriff or bishop was made responsible for a fraction of the
whole amount. The annuity was on several occasions in arrear. Thus Henry
IV in the first year of his reign granted the friars ‘of his abundant
favour’ (<i>de uberiori gratia nostra</i>) all the arrears that had accumulated
during the reign of his predecessor<a name='fna_642' id='fna_642' href='#f_642'><small>[642]</small></a>. Affairs of State made themselves
felt in the Franciscan convent. In 1450 Parliament passed a general act of
resumption, annulling all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> grants made since the King’s accession, and the
annuity to the friars ceased to be paid<a name='fna_643' id='fna_643' href='#f_643'><small>[643]</small></a>. The brethren represented to
Henry VI the hardships which this loss of revenue inflicted on them, and
in 1453 the King ordered the arrears to be paid,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘in order that the same warden and friars may be in a happier frame of
mind (<i>hillariorem animum habeant</i>) to offer up special prayers for us
to the Highest<a name='fna_644' id='fna_644' href='#f_644'><small>[644]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Under the circumstances we cannot be surprised if the friars sometimes
took legal measures to recover the debts due to them. It was no doubt in
connexion with this grant, that in 1466 Richard Clyff, ‘custos’ of the
Oxford Grey Friars (first in person and afterwards through his attorney)
sued John Broghton, late Sheriff of Kent, in the Court of Exchequer, for
100<i>s.</i> due to him from the preceding year, and claimed damages to the
amount of ten marks<a name='fna_645' id='fna_645' href='#f_645'><small>[645]</small></a>. In 1488, in like manner, Richard Salford, Warden
of the Friars Minors at Oxford, applied to the Barons of the Exchequer to
compel John Paston, Knt., late Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, to pay a
debt of £10 18<i>s.</i>, and put in a claim to £10 damages; he recovered the
debt, but the damages were reduced to 26<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i><a name='fna_646' id='fna_646' href='#f_646'><small>[646]</small></a> On the same day he
sued Edmund Bedyngfeld, Knt., late Sheriff of the same counties of Norfolk
and Suffolk, for a debt of ‘seven pounds of silver’ and 100<i>s.</i> damages;
the amount of the debt and 20<i>s.</i> damages were awarded him<a name='fna_647' id='fna_647' href='#f_647'><small>[647]</small></a>. The next
year he again brought an action against the same Bedyngfeld and recovered
the debt (£4 2<i>s.</i>), while the barons assessed his damages at 10<i>s.</i>
instead of the £4 which he claimed<a name='fna_648' id='fna_648' href='#f_648'><small>[648]</small></a>. We gather from these instances
that though the annuity was usually paid and was not often much in arrear,
it was not collected without considerable trouble and expense on the part
of the friars. These actions involved a journey to London and the
employment of an attorney<a name='fna_649' id='fna_649' href='#f_649'><small>[649]</small></a>: they were never settled in one day, and
weeks or months elapsed between the first hearing and the second.</p>

<p>The Grey Friars were also in receipt of annual or weekly alms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> from others
besides the King. Durham College paid them 50<i>s.</i> yearly<a name='fna_650' id='fna_650' href='#f_650'><small>[650]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘In ye accompts of S. Ebbs made before 1542, it appears in all, y<sup>t</sup>
ye churchwardens of S. Ebbs parish paid to ye warden of ye Grey
Freyers Oxon 6<i>d.</i> per annum<a name='fna_651' id='fna_651' href='#f_651'><small>[651]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The nunnery of Godstow<a name='fna_652' id='fna_652' href='#f_652'><small>[652]</small></a> gave every week alternately to the Friars’
Preachers and Minors</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘fourteen loaves of the best wheat’ (<i>pasto</i>), worth in money value
8<i>d.</i> a week, ‘for the soul of Roger Writtell; and the aforesaid
friars shall have the seal of the monastery to the amount of 34<i>s.</i> a
year.’</p></div>

<p>The nuns also gave annually to each of the four Orders of friars at Oxford
3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> in money, and ‘one peck (<i>modium</i>) of oytemell and one of peas
(<i>pisarum</i>) in Lent.’ Among the ‘perpetual alms’ of Osney Abbey is
mentioned a grant of 20<i>s.</i> to the four Orders, as the price of one ox, at
Christmas, and of 4<i>d.</i> a week to each Order ‘according to ancient
custom<a name='fna_653' id='fna_653' href='#f_653'><small>[653]</small></a>.’</p>

<p>A large part of their revenue was derived from bequests. To minister to
the sick and the dying was one of the first duties which St. Francis
practised himself and enjoined on his followers: that in this respect the
English Franciscans followed his precepts may be seen in the tradition of
them which remained in the memory of this country and which Shakespeare
has expressed in ‘Romeo and Juliet’:</p>

<p class="poem">‘Going to find a barefoot brother out,<br />
One of our order, to associate me,<br />
Here in this city visiting the sick,<br />
And finding him, the searchers of the town,<br />
Suspecting that we both were in a house<br />
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,<br />
Seal’d up the doors and would not let us forth.’<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">(Act V, Scene II.)</span></p>

<p>But work like this receives little notice in history, and where it is
mentioned it is usually upon the sordid aspect of the case&mdash;the greed for
legacies&mdash;that the chroniclers insist.</p>

<p>In connexion with Oxford there are perhaps in the extant records only two
instances of a Franciscan being found in the chamber of sickness or death.
On Nov. 24, 1357, the will of Robert de Trenge<a name='fna_654' id='fna_654' href='#f_654'><small>[654]</small></a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> Warden of Merton,
was proved by the sworn testimony of Friar John of Nottingham of the Order
of Friars Minors, and Master Walter Moryn, clerk. The will itself is dated
June 14, 1351, but in the Middle Ages it was rarely that a man made his
will until he felt that his hours were numbered, and although Robert de
Trenge seems to have lived some time longer, he was probably now lying in
expectation of death, struck down perhaps by the dreaded plague.</p>

<p>The other instance is of later date, namely 10th Dec., 1514<a name='fna_655' id='fna_655' href='#f_655'><small>[655]</small></a>. A
scholar, John Eustas, had died intestate at Oxford;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘at the instance of his administrators, Friar Richard of Ireland, of
the Order of Minors, appeared before us (the commissary), and
confessed that he had abstracted from the goods of the aforesaid dead
man, without competent legal authority, two mantles and thirty-one
yards of linen cloth, and in gold 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, which goods he has
still in his possession.’</p></div>

<p>A few days later Friar Richard Lorcan was ordered by the court to restore
these goods under penalty of the law<a name='fna_656' id='fna_656' href='#f_656'><small>[656]</small></a>.</p>

<p>It is, however, in the wills of men and women of every rank and every
status that we get most insight into the work of the friars as visitors of
the sick. Unfortunately we possess but few wills as early as the
thirteenth or first half of the fourteenth century, while for the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, when the popularity of the friars had
greatly declined, they are fairly numerous. Taking those proved in the
Chancellor’s court between 1436 and 1538, we find that one will in every
eight, roughly speaking<a name='fna_657' id='fna_657' href='#f_657'><small>[657]</small></a>, contains a bequest to the Minorites. In the
‘Old White Book’ (Oxford City Records)<a name='fna_658' id='fna_658' href='#f_658'><small>[658]</small></a>, the proportion is about one
to every four or five, and in the last half of the fourteenth century,
one-third of the wills of Oxford citizens contain bequests to the
Franciscans; and these figures are borne out by the Oxford wills scattered
through the early Registers at Somerset House<a name='fna_659' id='fna_659' href='#f_659'><small>[659]</small></a>. The legacies come from
all ranks; tradesmen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> merchants being especially well represented. Nor
were the benefactors confined to Oxford and its neighbourhood: the
Convent, like the University, occupied a national position. But it will be
best to give as complete a list as possible of the bequests to the Grey
Friars, and leave readers to draw their own conclusions.</p>

<p><i>John of St. John</i><a name='fna_660' id='fna_660' href='#f_660'><small>[660]</small></a>, clerk, by an undated will, probably about 1230,
left half a mark to the Friars Minors of Oxford.</p>

<p><i>Martin de Sancta Cruce</i>, Master of the Hospital of Sherburn, near Durham,
left 10<i>s.</i> to them in 1259, with bequests to Friar Richard of Cornwall
and others<a name='fna_661' id='fna_661' href='#f_661'><small>[661]</small></a>.</p>

<p><i>Boniface of Savoy</i>, Archbishop of Canterbury, left them fifteen marks at
his death in 1270<a name='fna_662' id='fna_662' href='#f_662'><small>[662]</small></a>.</p>

<p><i>Nicholas de Weston</i>, citizen of Oxford, left them 10<i>s.</i> in 1271<a name='fna_663' id='fna_663' href='#f_663'><small>[663]</small></a>.</p>

<p><i>Walter de Merton</i>, Bishop of Rochester, Chancellor of England, and
founder of Merton College, bequeathed twenty-five marks to them at his
death in 1277<a name='fna_664' id='fna_664' href='#f_664'><small>[664]</small></a>.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Waldere</i>, of Wycombe, left them 2<i>s.</i> in 1291<a name='fna_665' id='fna_665' href='#f_665'><small>[665]</small></a>.</p>

<p><i>Amaury de Montfort</i><a name='fna_666' id='fna_666' href='#f_666'><small>[666]</small></a>, papal chaplain, Treasurer of York, &amp;c. in an
elaborate will dated Feb. 2nd, 1300/1, ordered that ‘the goods and
revenues of the aforesaid Treasury owed to him’ should be divided into
three parts; one-third was to be subdivided into six parts; the sixth part
was to be again subdivided into three parts, one of which was to go to the
Friars Preachers of Oxford, Leicester, and elsewhere; the second</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>‘fratribus Minoribus, Carmelitis, Oxonii, Leycestrie, Parisius, et
fratribus ordinis S. Trinitatis;’</p></div>

<p>the third, to pay any debts he might leave. As Amaury was dispossessed of
the Treasurership in Aug. 1265 (after holding it only for a few months),
and never recovered it, these bequests were merely a pious wish.</p>

<p><i>John de Doclington</i> bequeathed 20<i>s.</i> to each of the four Orders in
Oxford in 1335<a name='fna_667' id='fna_667' href='#f_667'><small>[667]</small></a>.</p>

<p><i>Nicholas Acton</i><a name='fna_668' id='fna_668' href='#f_668'><small>[668]</small></a>, parson of the church of Wystantowe (Salop), and
owner of property in London, left the Oxford Franciscans 40<i>s.</i> in 1337.</p>

<p><i>William de Burchestre</i> left them one marc in 1340<a name='fna_669' id='fna_669' href='#f_669'><small>[669]</small></a>.</p>

<p><i>John son of Walter Wrenche</i>, of Milton, spicer, by a will dated May 4th,
and proved on May 5th, 1349, gave to the Friars Preachers and Friars
Minors of Oxford each ten quarters of corn<a name='fna_670' id='fna_670' href='#f_670'><small>[670]</small></a>.</p>

<p><i>Edmund Bereford</i><a name='fna_671' id='fna_671' href='#f_671'><small>[671]</small></a>, lord of several manors near Oxford, in his will
dated Jan. 8th, 1350/1 and proved in 1354, gave, among many other pious
bequests, 20<i>s.</i> at his death and 10<i>s.</i> on his anniversary to the
Minorites.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Item volo quod xij trisennalia celebrentur pro anima mea, videlicet
... in quolibet ordine fratrum j trisennale.’</p></div>

<p><i>Henry Malmesbury</i>, citizen of Oxford, left them 20<i>s.</i> in 1361<a name='fna_672' id='fna_672' href='#f_672'><small>[672]</small></a>.</p>

<p><i>John de Bereford</i><a name='fna_673' id='fna_673' href='#f_673'><small>[673]</small></a>, citizen and sometime Mayor of Oxford, bequeathed
13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to each of the Orders in 1361,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘ut habeant animam meam inter eorum missas recommendatam.... Item,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span><i>Richard Bramptone</i>, butcher of Oxford, in 1362, left 10<i>s.</i> to be divided

<p><i>Walter de Berney</i><a name='fna_676' id='fna_676' href='#f_676'><small>[676]</small></a>, a wealthy citizen of London, with apparently no
near relations, was a benefactor: his will, made in 1377, contains, among
many similar bequests, the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Item fratribus minoribus Oxon’ et Cantebrig’ equaliter x li.’</p></div>

<p><i>Richard Carsewell</i>, butcher of Oxford, in 1389 left the house in which he

executors, with instructions to sell it</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘and to distribute to the poor friars minors of the money received for
the said tenement, ten marks<a name='fna_677' id='fna_677' href='#f_677'><small>[677]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p><i>John Ocle</i> or <i>Okele</i>, of Oxford, ‘skinner,’ left in 1390, 20<i>s.</i> a year
for three years to Friar John Schankton, of the Order of Minors, to
celebrate masses for the soul of the testator and his friends, in the
Franciscan church at Oxford. To the convent of Friars Minors he bequeathed
5<i>s.</i>, to celebrate divine service for him on the day or the morrow of his
death<a name='fna_678' id='fna_678' href='#f_678'><small>[678]</small></a>.</p>

<p><i>Sir John Golafre</i>, of Langley and Fyfield, knight, by will dated Jan.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span><i>Elizabeth Johnson</i>, of Oxford, widow, in 1537 left</p>

<p>The will was proved on Jan. 12th, 1538/9,&mdash;after the suppression of the
friaries<a name='fna_735' id='fna_735' href='#f_735'><small>[735]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Many testators authorized their executors to make due provision of
trentalls and masses ‘for the wealth of their souls,’ without specifying
where they were to be celebrated: the friars no doubt came in for a share
of these. Thus Thomas Hoye, Vicar of Bampton, in 1531 gives the following
instructions<a name='fna_736' id='fna_736' href='#f_736'><small>[736]</small></a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘It is my will that the forsaid goodes be preysid and put to vendicion
and the money therof cummyng to be ordered and distributed by myn
executors for trentallys of masses off Requiem eternam and masses of
the V woundes of our lord to be celebrate and said for the welthe of
my soule and all Christen sowles. Amen.’</p></div>

<p>On the other hand, the parish priests or rectors of churches were legally
entitled to one-fourth of the gifts, bequests, and fees given by their
parishioners to the friars<a name='fna_737' id='fna_737' href='#f_737'><small>[737]</small></a>: but it is impossible to say whether the
right was generally enforced. In 1521 Leo X,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘owing to the importunate exaction of the funeral fourth by some
rectors of churches,’</p></div>

<p>exempted the friars from the payment<a name='fna_738' id='fna_738' href='#f_738'><small>[738]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Among other sources of revenue may be enumerated the institution of annual
masses for fees (of which the wills often make mention), commutations of
penances for money<a name='fna_739' id='fna_739' href='#f_739'><small>[739]</small></a>, payment by the University and others for the use
of their church, schools, and other buildings on various occasions<a name='fna_740' id='fna_740' href='#f_740'><small>[740]</small></a>,
and collections in church<a name='fna_741' id='fna_741' href='#f_741'><small>[741]</small></a>. At the beginning of the sixteenth century
we hear of a</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘gild of St. Mary in the church of the Friars Minors<a name='fna_742' id='fna_742' href='#f_742'><small>[742]</small></a>,’</p></div>

<p>which no doubt supported one or more friars to say mass in one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> the ten
chapels. Of manual labour there is little evidence; the only kind
mentioned is the transcription of manuscripts of which we have already
spoken.</p>

<p>We may here say a few words on two other points. Firstly, from what
classes of society were the Franciscans mainly drawn? In the thirteenth
century a very large number of men of position, of high birth, were
attracted to the Order; but that this was unusual may be gathered from the
rejoicings which took place over converts who were ‘<i>valentes in
saeculo</i><a name='fna_743' id='fna_743' href='#f_743'><small>[743]</small></a>.’ There is every reason to suppose that the Grey Friars, as
well as the other students at the University, were mainly recruited from
the sons of tradesmen, artisans, and villeins<a name='fna_744' id='fna_744' href='#f_744'><small>[744]</small></a>. Friar Brackley, D.D.
was the son of a Norwich dyer<a name='fna_745' id='fna_745' href='#f_745'><small>[745]</small></a>; and the towns probably supplied the
greater proportion of the Oxford Franciscans<a name='fna_746' id='fna_746' href='#f_746'><small>[746]</small></a>. Secondly, what led men
to take the vows of the Minorites? Excluding again the thirteenth century
(when the highest motives were predominant), and confining ourselves to
the later times, we must admit that, apart from those who entered the
Order as boys, either from choice or at the instigation or compulsion of
relatives<a name='fna_747' id='fna_747' href='#f_747'><small>[747]</small></a>&mdash;the leading motive was a superstitious belief in the
externals of religion, in the efficacy of ‘the washing of cups and pots.’
How strong this feeling was may be seen from the fact that Latimer was at
one time in danger of yielding to it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘I have thought,’ he wrote to Sir Edward Baynton, ‘that if I had been
a friar in a cowl, I could not have been damned, nor afraid of death;
and in my sickness I have been tempted to become a friar<a name='fna_748' id='fna_748' href='#f_748'><small>[748]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The intellectual torpor which oppressed Oxford for more than a century
after the disappearance of Wiclif and his followers was due less to the
repressive measures adopted by Archbishop Arundel, than to the want of
vitality, of adaptability to new modes of thought, in the scholastic
philosophy and method, with which the intellectual life of Oxford had for
so long been identified. The University as a whole did not extend a warm
welcome to the New Learning, and it was to be expected that the Mendicant
Orders especially should be attached to the old state of things, with
which their past greatness was connected, and to which their present
position and any prestige they still possessed were due<a name='fna_749' id='fna_749' href='#f_749'><small>[749]</small></a>. The Grey
Friars consequently were inclined to oppose the revival of learning; and
Tyndale no doubt classed them among ‘the old barking curs, Duns’ disciples
and like draff called Scotists, the children of darkness,’ who ‘raged in
every pulpit against Greek, Latin, and Hebrew<a name='fna_750' id='fna_750' href='#f_750'><small>[750]</small></a>.’ Dr. Henry Standish,
sometime Warden of the Grey Friars of London and Provincial Minister of
England, attacked Erasmus’ version of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> New Testament in a sermon at
Paul’s Cross and in conversation at Court, and seems to have been the
recognised leader of the ‘Trojan’ party in England<a name='fna_751' id='fna_751' href='#f_751'><small>[751]</small></a>. But even among
the Minorites there are traces of the influence of the Renaissance.
Another Provincial Minister, Richard Brynkley, was a student of Greek, and
was supplied with a copy of the Gospels in Greek from the Franciscan
Library at Oxford. Friar Nicholas de Burgo seems to have been one of that
band of Humanists whom Wolsey attracted to Oxford, that they might
propagate in his own University the learning and culture of Italy<a name='fna_752' id='fna_752' href='#f_752'><small>[752]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The close historical relation, notwithstanding the fundamental
differences, between the intellectual movement and the religious movement,
was neatly expressed in a saying current among the friars: ‘Erasmus laid
the egg; Luther hatched it<a name='fna_753' id='fna_753' href='#f_753'><small>[753]</small></a>.’ The beginnings of the English
Reformation in its religious aspect are to be sought among the educated
classes, especially at Cambridge. The Minorites, while generally hostile
to the new religion<a name='fna_754' id='fna_754' href='#f_754'><small>[754]</small></a>, did not take a leading part in suppressing it.
And when it is remembered how very little progress the Lutheran doctrines
made in England before the Dissolution, the few instances of sympathy with
those doctrines recorded in the lives of Oxford Franciscans acquire a
certain importance<a name='fna_755' id='fna_755' href='#f_755'><small>[755]</small></a>. These, however, were exceptional cases. If we
trace the fortunes of individual Franciscans after the Dissolution, it
will be found that no generalization as to their attitude towards the
Reformation can be made. A few remained loyal to the old religion<a name='fna_756' id='fna_756' href='#f_756'><small>[756]</small></a>,
others embraced the new<a name='fna_757' id='fna_757' href='#f_757'><small>[757]</small></a>, and on both sides persecution was suffered
for conscience’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> sake<a name='fna_758' id='fna_758' href='#f_758'><small>[758]</small></a>; others again contrived to reconcile themselves
with both old and new according to circumstances<a name='fna_759' id='fna_759' href='#f_759'><small>[759]</small></a>.</p>

<p>With the Reformation as a political movement, the Franciscans had more
sympathy. A large section of them had, long before this, taught the
supremacy of the State over the Church in all things political<a name='fna_760' id='fna_760' href='#f_760'><small>[760]</small></a>; they
approved in principle the confiscation of Church-property for the common
good<a name='fna_761' id='fna_761' href='#f_761'><small>[761]</small></a>; and Friar Henry Standish, in defending the claim of the
temporal courts to try and punish criminous clerks, together with the
broad principles on which that claim rested, was only applying to present
circumstances the time-honoured traditions of his Order<a name='fna_762' id='fna_762' href='#f_762'><small>[762]</small></a>. It is true
that the Friars of the Observance resisted the royal supremacy in 1534.
But the supremacy claimed by Henry VIII went beyond anything asserted by
his predecessors, involving, as it did in effect, the establishment of a
lay jurisdiction superior to all ecclesiastical courts <i>in spiritualibus</i>
as well as <i>in temporalibus</i>, constituting Henry ‘a king with a pope in
his belly’<a name='fna_763' id='fna_763' href='#f_763'><small>[763]</small></a>. The Franciscans at Oxford seem, like most of the
religious, to have accepted the supremacy in this extended form and to
have taken the oath without demur: at least there is no evidence to the
contrary<a name='fna_764' id='fna_764' href='#f_764'><small>[764]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The oath administered to the monks and friars involved an acknowledgment,
not only of the royal supremacy, but of the lawfulness of Henry’s divorce
from Katharine and marriage with Anne Boleyn, and a promise to preach the
same on every occasion<a name='fna_765' id='fna_765' href='#f_765'><small>[765]</small></a>. The attitude of the Oxford Franciscans to the
divorce, so far as it can be ascertained, may be briefly stated here.</p>

<p>Henry attached great importance to securing a decision in favour of his
divorce from the chief universities of Europe. The divorce became the
all-absorbing topic at Oxford; and individual Minorites took a prominent
part in the discussions. But the convent as a whole did not present a
united front. Dr. Thomas Kirkham, a Franciscan, is mentioned as one of the
Doctors of Divinity who opposed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> divorce and were ready to write
against it<a name='fna_766' id='fna_766' href='#f_766'><small>[766]</small></a>. Dr. Kynton seems to have been on the same side at
first<a name='fna_767' id='fna_767' href='#f_767'><small>[767]</small></a>; Archbishop Warham complained of his having spread calumnious
reports about himself in connexion with the ‘King’s matter,’ and demanded
his punishment. But it is doubtful whether in the end Kynton had the
courage of his opinions; he was one of the committee of three appointed by
the theological faculty to decide the question with the assistance of
thirty other members to be nominated by the smaller committee<a name='fna_768' id='fna_768' href='#f_768'><small>[768]</small></a>. This
body subsequently issued, in the name of the University, the qualified
declaration in favour of the King, the tenour of which is well-known.</p>

<p>The most active champion of the King’s cause was also a Minorite, Dr.
Nicholas de Burgo, a native of Italy, who enjoyed the patronage of
Cardinal Wolsey<a name='fna_769' id='fna_769' href='#f_769'><small>[769]</small></a>. The unpopularity of the divorce, among those who
were guided by their sentiments rather than by their personal interests,
is shown by the treatment he received at Oxford. He was pelted with stones
in the street, and the good women of the town would have ‘foyled’ him ‘if
their handys might have served their harts’<a name='fna_770' id='fna_770' href='#f_770'><small>[770]</small></a>. In retaliation the friar
caused about thirty women to be locked up in Bocardo for three days and
nights<a name='fna_771' id='fna_771' href='#f_771'><small>[771]</small></a>. As we shall see later on, his services did not go
unrewarded<a name='fna_772' id='fna_772' href='#f_772'><small>[772]</small></a>. The position of Friar Nicholas, however, was exceptional,
and his action cannot be regarded as representative of the feelings of the
Oxford Convent.</p>

<p>The causes which led to the dissolution of the monasteries do not concern
us here. The friaries were not included in the Act of 1536 for the
abolition of the lesser monasteries; they possessed as a rule no estates
except the site on which they were built, and the gains to be derived from
their disendowment were perhaps regarded as insufficient compensation for
the odium which the measure would necessarily involve. The first blow had
already fallen upon the Observant Friars, the fearless champions of the
legality of the Queen Katharine’s marriage and of the Papal supremacy. The
conventuals were left alone till Henry decided on the general suppression
of the religious houses throughout England. The object of the royal party
was then to obtain what was called a ‘voluntary’ surrender of their
property from the members of each religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> community; and among those
who had the courage to offer opposition were many houses of Franciscans,
‘with hom,’ writes the Bishop of Dover, ‘in every place I have moche
besynes’<a name='fna_773' id='fna_773' href='#f_773'><small>[773]</small></a>. But among these we cannot reckon the convent at Oxford.</p>

<p>In 1535 Cromwell sent his agent, Layton, and others, to Oxford to reform
the University. After abolishing the study of the schoolmen<a name='fna_774' id='fna_774' href='#f_774'><small>[774]</small></a>, the
visitors proceeded to deal with the religious students<a name='fna_775' id='fna_775' href='#f_775'><small>[775]</small></a>. For the
reform of the monasteries, they were armed with a set of eighty-six
articles of inquiry and twenty-five injunctions<a name='fna_776' id='fna_776' href='#f_776'><small>[776]</small></a>, the real though not
avowed object of which was to make monastic life unbearable and so to
prepare the way for ‘voluntary’ surrenders<a name='fna_777' id='fna_777' href='#f_777'><small>[777]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘We have further,’ writes Dr. Layton to Cromwell on the 12th of
September<a name='fna_778' id='fna_778' href='#f_778'><small>[778]</small></a>, ‘in visitynge the religiouse studenttes, emongyste all
other injunctions, adjoyned that none of them for no manner of cause
shall cum within any taverne, in, alhowse, or any other howse
whatsoever hit be, within the towne and the suburbs of the same, upon
payne onse so taken by day or by nyght, to be sent imediatly home to
his cloister whereas he was professede. Withoute doubte we here say
this acte to be gretly lamentede of all the duble honeste women of the

they wer ryght well accustomede. I doubt not but for this thyng onely
the honeste matrones will sew unto yowe for a redresse.’</p></div>

<p>It is probable, that, between this time and the summer and autumn of 1538,
when the general dissolution of the friaries took place, many of the
Oxford Franciscans had left their house<a name='fna_779' id='fna_779' href='#f_779'><small>[779]</small></a>. The Friary, it will be seen,
was wretchedly poor and in a ruinous condition; ‘and few do geve any almys
to them’<a name='fna_780' id='fna_780' href='#f_780'><small>[780]</small></a>. The commission to visit the Oxford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> friaries in 1538
consisted of Dr. John London, the mayor (Mr. Banaster) and ‘master
aldermen’ (apparently Mr. Pye and Mr. Fryer). On the 8th of July<a name='fna_781' id='fna_781' href='#f_781'><small>[781]</small></a>, Dr.
London writes to Cromwell that he and his fellow-commissioners have been
‘at all the places of the fryers in Oxforde,’ and wishing ‘to know your
lordeships pleasur’ on certain doubtful points, he proceeds to give an
account of his work.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘At Mr. Pyei’s comyng home Mr. Maier and Mr. ffryer wer at London, and

<p>After visiting the Carmelites and Austin Friars, they came to the Grey

<p>The treatment of the friars themselves was a more complicated problem. All
of them seem to have been willing to become secular priests, and London
urged</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘that with spede we may haue ther capacyties, ffor the longer they
tary the more they will wast<a name='fna_789' id='fna_789' href='#f_789'><small>[789]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>On the 14th of August<a name='fna_790' id='fna_790' href='#f_790'><small>[790]</small></a> he complains that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘as yet we haue nott the capacities and therfor be at the chardge in
fyndyng them mete and drink.’</p></div>

<p>On the 31st of August, again, he writes to Cromwell from Oxford<a name='fna_791' id='fna_791' href='#f_791'><small>[791]</small></a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘I have causyd all our fower ordre of fryers to change ther cotes, and
have despacchide them as well as I can till they may receyve ther

many thinges as well in London as otherwise, wiche he hath promised me
to declare unto your lordeschippe, if it be your pleasur he schall so

<p>The list of Oxford Grey Friars who ‘wold haue ther capacytis’ which was
sent to Cromwell<a name='fna_793' id='fna_793' href='#f_793'><small>[793]</small></a>, contains eighteen names, thirteen of them being
priests, one subdeacon, and four not in holy orders. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> names are:
Edward Baskerfelde, Warden, S.T.P.<a name='fna_794' id='fna_794' href='#f_794'><small>[794]</small></a>; Friars Brian Sanden, Richard
Roper, B.D., Rodulph Kyrswell, Robert Newman, William Brown, John Covire
(or Conire or Comre), James Cantwell, Thomas Cappes, John Stafforde Schyer
(?), William Bowghnell, James Smyzth, Thomas Wythman, priests; Friar John
Olliff, subdeacon; and Friars Symon Ludforth, Thomas Barly, William Cok,
and John Cok, <i>non infra sacros</i>.</p>

<p>It is not often possible to trace the subsequent career of the friars when
they had been turned adrift on the world. The monks as a rule received
pensions, and the entries respecting the payment of these in the
Ministers’ Accounts and other records, afford some clue to their fate. The
Mendicants except in a few isolated cases received no pensions. Dr. London
in his letter of the 8th of July<a name='fna_795' id='fna_795' href='#f_795'><small>[795]</small></a> asked Cromwell</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘what reward euery freer shall have ...<a name='fna_796' id='fna_796' href='#f_796'><small>[796]</small></a> at ther departinge,’</p></div>

<p>but the question no doubt refers merely to the gift of a few shillings,
which was usually made to each friar on his dismissal. No instance occurs
in the records of a pension having been paid to any of the Grey Friars who
were at Oxford at the time of the suppression<a name='fna_797' id='fna_797' href='#f_797'><small>[797]</small></a>. It is probable that
Baskerfeld, who was an important person in the University, received a
benefice with license to live in Oxford. Robert Newman seems also to have
been presented to a living<a name='fna_798' id='fna_798' href='#f_798'><small>[798]</small></a>. But the career of only one of these
eighteen friars can be traced with any certainty. Simon Ludford, a native
of Bedford, became an apothecary in London. On November 6, 1553, he
supplicated for the degree of M.B. at Oxford after six years’ study in the
medical faculty. On November 27, he obtained the degree and was admitted
to practise. The College of Physicians remonstrated with the University
and recommended that the degree should be revoked on the ground of
Ludford’s ignorance. Though the University refused to withdraw its
license, the ex-friar proceeded to Cambridge, but the Physicians hastened
to warn the authorities there against him. They had, they wrote to the
University, already examined Ludford ‘on the 17th day before the Calends
of March, 1553’ (?), and, finding him completely ignorant of medicine,
philosophy, and the liberal sciences, and distinguished only by ‘blind
audacity,’ unanimously voted against his admission. Ludford left
Cambridge, but persevered. In May 1560,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> he supplicated for the degree of
M.D. at Oxford, stating that he had long practised in London by permission
of the London College of Physicians. In July he incepted as M.D. of
Oxford. In April 1563 he was made fellow of the College of Physicians, and
he was censor of the same College in 1564, 1569, and 1572.<a name='fna_799' id='fna_799' href='#f_799'><small>[799]</small></a></p>

<p>We turn now to the Minorites who had studied at Oxford, but who were
living in other convents at the time of the dissolution. Of these a
considerable number obtained benefices<a name='fna_800' id='fna_800' href='#f_800'><small>[800]</small></a>, a few even rising to
positions of some importance in the Church<a name='fna_801' id='fna_801' href='#f_801'><small>[801]</small></a>. But what proportion these
successful cases bore to the unsuccessful cannot be even approximately
ascertained; it would naturally be higher among friars who had received a
university education than among the common herd. Yet it is unlikely that a
majority even of the former were presented to livings. The number of
disbanded monks and friars seeking employment as priests must have been
very large, and at the same time the demand for priests was growing less
and less.<a name='fna_802' id='fna_802' href='#f_802'><small>[802]</small></a> Some of the friars probably drifted into secular
employments; others perhaps joined the ranks of the ‘sturdy beggars’ of
whom so much is heard in the sixteenth century. It can hardly be doubted
but that the lot of many was one of hardship and suffering.</p>

<p>In the eyes of Cromwell and his royal master the only question of real
importance was the most advantageous disposal of the property. The
buildings of the Grey Friars were of little account, and the convent was
among those</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘howses of freres that have no substance of lead, save only some of
them haue smale gutters<a name='fna_803' id='fna_803' href='#f_803'><small>[803]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The site, however, was of considerable value, Dr. London was anxious that
it should be secured for the city; and his letter<a name='fna_804' id='fna_804' href='#f_804'><small>[804]</small></a> gives a curious
picture of the state of Oxford at the time of the dissolution.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘It ys rumoryd her that dyuers of the garde do intende to begge thees
howsys of the Kinges hyghnes, and that with other consideracions
moveth me now to be an humble petitioner vnto your lordeschippe for my
neybours. We haue in Oxforde two of the Kinges grace’s seruantes <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>Mr.
Banaster and Mr. Pye, two as burgerly and as honest men as lyveth in
any town and hathe no thing to lyve vpon, nother farmes abrode nor
fees saving oonly ther wages of the Kinges grace iiij<i>d.</i> a daye. Mr.
Banaster ys now mayer, and Mr. Pye hath be mayer, to hys great
chardge.’</p></div>

<p>The writer then urges that Mr. Banaster should have the site (‘cyte’) and
profits of the White Friars, Mr. Pye those of the fair of the Austin
Friars.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Mr. Pye specially hath be diligent to bring vnto the Kinges grace’s
hondes thees howses, and therefor I besek your gudd lordeschipp to be
gudd lord vnto hym. And syns Mr. Mayer com home he ys as diligent as
maye be and so is Mr. ffryer.’</p></div>

<p>London goes on to plead for his ‘neybours of Oxford,’</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘seying so gudd an occasion ys come wherin your lordeschipp may do
vnto them the hyest benefytt that euer dydd honorable man. The
greatest occasion of the povertie of thys town ys the payment of ther
fee-farme. ffor thys ys customablie seen, that such as befor they haue
be bayliffes hath be prety occupyers, if in ther yere corn be nott at
a hie price, then they be nott able to pay ther fee-farme. And for the
worschipp of ther town they must that yere kepe the better howsys,

that few of them can recouer agen. If by your gudde lordeschips

the Kinges grace schuld save a C markes yerly in hys cofers by reason
of the grey and black fryers wich hath euery of them C (<i>sic</i>) markes

<p>The plan here sketched out, creditable as it is to its author, was not
carried into effect. On August 10th, 1540, William Frewers and John Pye of
Oxford, obtained a lease of the house and site of the Grey Friars,
together with the grove containing by estimation five acres, for
twenty-one years, at a rent of 20<i>s.</i> a year&mdash;half the amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> of the rent
which the same persons paid for the Black Friars<a name='fna_805' id='fna_805' href='#f_805'><small>[805]</small></a>. Much of the Grey
Friars’ property was expressly excepted from this lease; namely, the close
called ‘le Churcheyarde’ now held by Richard Gunter of Oxford at an annual
rent of 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, the orchard or garden called ‘Paradise,’ and the
garden called ‘Boteham,’ now held by William Thomas at an annual rent of
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Further all large trees and shrubs were reserved to the King,
together with all those buildings within the precincts of the two friaries
‘which the King had commanded to be levelled or taken away.’</p>

<p>In 1544 the tenants seem to have opened negotiations for the purchase of
the property. In the official ‘particulars’ sent up to the royal
commissioners we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘These houses of ffryers ar wythin the towne of Oxford and as I haue
lernyd they ar not nyghe eny of the Kinges houses neyther hys graces
parkes fforestes and chase by seven myles. And what ffyne wylbe gyuen
ffor the same I know not neyther can lerne. And they ar the ffermers
them selues y<sup>t</sup> desyreth to by the premysses<a name='fna_806' id='fna_806' href='#f_806'><small>[806]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The price which the tenants offered was probably unsatisfactory; the
impecunious Pye with his wages of 4<i>d.</i> a day can hardly have had a chance
against wealthier speculators in monastic lands. In 1544 a successful bid
was made by Richard Andrewes of Hales, Esquire (Glouc.), one of the
largest of these speculators<a name='fna_807' id='fna_807' href='#f_807'><small>[807]</small></a>, who as usual was acting in partnership
with another, in this case John Howe. On July 14th, 1544, the King granted
to these two, in consideration of £1094 3<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> paid by Richard
Andrewes, various monastic lands in the counties of Derby, Middlesex,
Oxford, &amp;c., including the sites of the Black and Grey Friars in
Oxford<a name='fna_808' id='fna_808' href='#f_808'><small>[808]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘We give also and for the aforesaid consideration by these presents
concede to the said Richard Andrewes and John Howe, the whole site of
the house late of the friars Minors, commonly called “les Grey
ffreers” within the town of Oxford now dissolved. And also our whole
grove of land and wood with its appurtenances containing by estimation
five acres of land, now or late in the tenure or occupation of William
ffrewers and John Pye or their assigns; and our whole close of land
called ‘le Churcheyarde’ with its appurtenances, now or late in the
tenure or <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>occupation of James Gunter or his assigns; and our whole
garden or orchard called “Paradyse,” and our whole garden called
Bateham or Boteham, now or late in the tenure or occupation of William
Thomas or his assigns, with all and each of their appurtenances
situated within the town of Oxford, lately belonging to the priory or
house of the friars Minors ...; and all our houses, buildings, stables,
granaries, curtilages, gardens (<i>ortos</i>), orchards, gardens
(<i>gardina</i>), waters, ponds, vineyards, land and soil whatsoever with
their appurtenances lying within the said boundary of the house of the
friars Minors.... Which site of the late house of friars Minors and
all the aforesaid houses, buildings, gardens, orchards, &amp;c., belonging
thereto, now amount (<i>extenduntur</i>) to the clear annual value of
30<i>s.</i>... We except however always and totally reserve out of the
present concession, all the bells and the whole of the lead and glass
on the said houses of the friars Minors and Preachers, except the lead
and glass in the gutters and windows of the houses or mansions of the
same friars: and also in like manner all the buildings and structures
of the late churches, cloisters, refectories, dormitories, and
chapterhouses of the said friars.’</p></div>

<p>All the property granted was to be held by Richard Andrewes and John Howe
and the heirs and assigns of Richard Andrewes, in chief, ‘for the service
of the twentieth part of one knight’s fee.’ An annual rent was to be paid
to the King from each parcel of property, the rent of the site of the
Friars Minors being 3<i>s.</i>, that of the Friars Preachers 4<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The purchase was purely a matter of speculation, and the next month
(August 26th, 1544), Andrewes and Howe obtained from the King, for a fine
of 9<i>s.</i>, license to alienate the site of the Grey Friars, with the grove,
churchyard, Paradise, and Boteham, and the buildings, except those already
reserved for the King, to Richard Gunter, alderman of Oxford, and Joanna
his wife, and the heirs and assigns of Richard Gunter, to be held by them
‘for the services due thence to us, our heirs, and successors<a name='fna_809' id='fna_809' href='#f_809'><small>[809]</small></a>.’ It
does not appear whether the leases of Frewers, Pye, and Thomas, were
cancelled or allowed to run their course.</p>

<p>The subsequent history of the property is obscure, and probably would not
repay an exhaustive investigation. Wood states that the land</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘being shifted through severall hands doth now acknowledg also
severall owners<a name='fna_810' id='fna_810' href='#f_810'><small>[810]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Part of it was ‘now inhabited by tanners<a name='fna_811' id='fna_811' href='#f_811'><small>[811]</small></a>.’ The island or grove on the
south of Trill Mill stream belonged</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>‘to Sir William Moorton, Kt., Judge of the King’s Bench, in right of
his wife Anne, daughter and heir of John Smyth of Oxford, Gent<a name='fna_812' id='fna_812' href='#f_812'><small>[812]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Writing about a century later, Peshall states that the site</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘now forms the messuage or Tenement and large Yard of Charles Collins,
Gent; the Garden, Orchard, and Tenement of Swithin Adee, M.D., late
Sir James Cotter’s, Bart., and the large Garden and Orchard called
Paradise Garden. The Island in their possession ... is occupied by Mr.
Shirley, which serves partly for a Tan Yard and Buildings necessary
thereto<a name='fna_813' id='fna_813' href='#f_813'><small>[813]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>In a short time little was left of the buildings&mdash;so complete was the work
of destruction. ‘The trees were soon cut down, all the greens trod under
foot, the church thrown down, and the stones, with the images and
monuments of the greatest value, scattered about<a name='fna_814' id='fna_814' href='#f_814'><small>[814]</small></a>.’ The name only
survived; Agas in his map (1578) puts the <i>Graie Friers</i> where the house
of the Black Friars stood. ‘The ruins of this college are gone to ruine,’
wrote Wood, ‘and almost lodged in obscurity<a name='fna_815' id='fna_815' href='#f_815'><small>[815]</small></a>:’ and the ‘scanty
fragments’ (<i>rudera paucula</i>) which were visible to Hearne and Parkinson
as they walked towards the Watergate<a name='fna_816' id='fna_816' href='#f_816'><small>[816]</small></a> have long since vanished. Even
the use to which the materials were put is unknown. Some of the stones
form no doubt the foundation-work of many houses in St. Ebbe’s: but while
something definite is known about the materials of the Houses of the other
Mendicant Orders, the records are silent respecting the greatest of the
friaries<a name='fna_817' id='fna_817' href='#f_817'><small>[817]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Unlike the Abbots and Priors of the <i>religiosi possessionati</i>, the heads
of the Mendicant Houses required no royal assent to their appointment.
Their names consequently do not occur in the royal records, and to this
fact is due the incompleteness of the following list of the custodians and
wardens of the Grey Friars at Oxford. It is a noteworthy if not surprising
fact, that not a single original work by any of these men can now be
found.</p>

<p><b>William of Esseby</b> (perhaps Ashby in Norfolk)<a name='fna_818' id='fna_818' href='#f_818'><small>[818]</small></a>, the first warden, was
one of the four clerks who came to England with Agnellus in 1224; he was
then a young man and a novice, having recently joined the Order in
France<a name='fna_819' id='fna_819' href='#f_819'><small>[819]</small></a>, and only assumed the habit of a <i>professus</i> when he became
warden at Oxford<a name='fna_820' id='fna_820' href='#f_820'><small>[820]</small></a>. He was among the first three Minorites authorized
to preach in England<a name='fna_821' id='fna_821' href='#f_821'><small>[821]</small></a>.</p>

<p>When the English Province was divided into custodies (c. 1226?), he was
made custodian of Oxford<a name='fna_822' id='fna_822' href='#f_822'><small>[822]</small></a>. Afterwards he was sent to found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> the
convent at Cambridge, and Eccleston draws a strange picture of him
solemnly chanting the service, with one other friar and a crippled novice,
in the wooden shed which served for a chapel<a name='fna_823' id='fna_823' href='#f_823'><small>[823]</small></a>. Later William is heard
of at Northampton<a name='fna_824' id='fna_824' href='#f_824'><small>[824]</small></a>. About 1238, he was sent by Friar Wygmund, the
German <i>visitator</i> of England, to visit Ireland; his mission here proved
as abortive as that of the German in England; on his return he went to
Cologne to join Wygmund<a name='fna_825' id='fna_825' href='#f_825'><small>[825]</small></a>. He had ceased to be warden or custodian of
Oxford before 1237<a name='fna_826' id='fna_826' href='#f_826'><small>[826]</small></a>. He was alive when William of Nottingham became
Provincial Minister, and died ‘after many years’ at London<a name='fna_827' id='fna_827' href='#f_827'><small>[827]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Eccleston gives him a high character. He was specially distinguished for
his obedience.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘When Friar Gregory, the Provincial Minister of France, asked him
whether he would like to go to his native land, he said, he did not
know what he would like, because his will was not his own, but the
Minister’s; so, whatever the Minister would, he would<a name='fna_828' id='fna_828' href='#f_828'><small>[828]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>By his tact he did much towards winning for his Order the affection of the
world, and he was instrumental in leading many fit persons of various
ranks and ages ‘to the way of salvation<a name='fna_829' id='fna_829' href='#f_829'><small>[829]</small></a>.’</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Cambridge Univ. Library, MS. Ii I. 24, p. 332. seq. (sec. xiv)
contains a sermon by the ‘<i>Prior de Essebi de artificioso modo
predicandi</i>,’ and other sermons perhaps by the same author. Tanner and
others suggest that this Essebi may be the Franciscan: but ‘Prior’ was
a title unknown in the Franciscan Order. The author was probably a
Prior of Canons Ashby.</p></div>

<p><b>Eustace de Merc</b> was a member of the Oxford convent in the lifetime of
Agnellus, and had license to hear confessions; he was warden at the time
of the visitatorial chapter held by Friar Wygred or Wygmund in 1237-8. On
this occasion many accusations were brought against him, in consequence of
which he was for a day and a half excluded from the chapter; the charges
are not specified and do not seem to have been proved. After fulfilling
the duties of warden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> for a long time, he became custodian of York. The
date of his death is unknown.</p>

<p>While he always showed to others ‘the sweetness of an angelic affection,’
he subjected himself until the end of his life to the severest discipline;
even in his earlier years, his fasts and vigils and self-inflicted stripes
endangered his health, and called forth the remonstrances of his
superiors<a name='fna_830' id='fna_830' href='#f_830'><small>[830]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Peter of Tewkesbury.</b> It is uncertain whether ‘Friar Peter, custodian of
Oxford’ is to be identified with Peter of Tewkesbury; but a comparison of
the dates, so far as they can be ascertained, brings out nothing
inconsistent with this supposition, and we shall put the facts about both
of them together. Peter of Tewkesbury was warden of London about 1234;
about this time he went to Rome with Agnellus and some Friars Preachers on
behalf of the English prelates<a name='fna_831' id='fna_831' href='#f_831'><small>[831]</small></a>. Agnellus confessed to him on his
death-bed and constituted him his vicar<a name='fna_832' id='fna_832' href='#f_832'><small>[832]</small></a>. When Albert of Pisa was
Provincial, Friar Peter was custodian of Oxford; he held the office for
twelve years (1236-48?)<a name='fna_833' id='fna_833' href='#f_833'><small>[833]</small></a>. During the generalship of Haymo, ‘Friar
Peter, custodian of Oxford’ was one of the three friars chosen for the
English province to note doubtful points in the Rule<a name='fna_834' id='fna_834' href='#f_834'><small>[834]</small></a>. In 1245 he
again appears as custodian; Adam mentions having written a detailed
account to him about the proceedings at or before the Council of
Lyons<a name='fna_835' id='fna_835' href='#f_835'><small>[835]</small></a>. Peter of Tewkesbury was at the general chapter of the friars
at Genoa in 1244, and remained afterwards to obtain and take back two
Papal bulls about the Friars Preachers and Minors, evidently the
revocation of the bull providing that no Minorite should receive the
<i>obligati</i> of the Preachers into his Order<a name='fna_836' id='fna_836' href='#f_836'><small>[836]</small></a>. When John of Stamford
fell ill on his return from Lyons, Peter of Tewkesbury was sent to Mantes
to come back with Adam Marsh, at Grostete’s request<a name='fna_837' id='fna_837' href='#f_837'><small>[837]</small></a>. In 1250 he was
minister of Cologne<a name='fna_838' id='fna_838' href='#f_838'><small>[838]</small></a>. It was probably in the next year that he was
elected fifth Provincial of England after the death of William of
Nottingham<a name='fna_839' id='fna_839' href='#f_839'><small>[839]</small></a>: he was succeeded by John of Stamford about 1256 or
1257<a name='fna_840' id='fna_840' href='#f_840'><small>[840]</small></a>.
He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> an intimate friend of Robert Grostete, ‘from whom he
often heard many secrets of wisdom.’<a name='fna_841' id='fna_841' href='#f_841'><small>[841]</small></a> Eccleston says of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Friar Peter of Tewkesbury, minister of Germany, with God’s grace
defended the state of the Order against the King, legate, and many
false brethren, to such an extent that the fame of the fact spread to
many provinces, and his zeal of truth was invincibly proved<a name='fna_842' id='fna_842' href='#f_842'><small>[842]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He was buried at Bedford<a name='fna_843' id='fna_843' href='#f_843'><small>[843]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John of Stamford</b>, custodian of Oxford<a name='fna_844' id='fna_844' href='#f_844'><small>[844]</small></a>, was a man of great importance
among the friars. He was at the council of Lyons in 1245 as <i>socius</i> of
Adam Marsh<a name='fna_845' id='fna_845' href='#f_845'><small>[845]</small></a>. The Pope had some thoughts of sending him with others on
an embassy to the Chorasmeni, Tartars, and Saracens, who had attacked the
Holy Land, but the plan was not carried out<a name='fna_846' id='fna_846' href='#f_846'><small>[846]</small></a>. On his return, he was
taken ill at Beaune, and was tended by Adam Marsh<a name='fna_847' id='fna_847' href='#f_847'><small>[847]</small></a>. John of Stamford
was one of the three friars to whom the general entrusted the confirmation
of the election of William of Nottingham’s successor in the office of
Provincial Minister (1251)<a name='fna_848' id='fna_848' href='#f_848'><small>[848]</small></a>. Some time after 1245 he became custodian
of Oxford; he held the office in 1253 when Thomas of York incepted<a name='fna_849' id='fna_849' href='#f_849'><small>[849]</small></a>.
He joined about this time with Adam Marsh and Thomas of York in a petition
to the Provincial, begging for mercy for Hugh Cote, probably a lay
brother, who had stolen three horses of great value, and then
repented<a name='fna_850' id='fna_850' href='#f_850'><small>[850]</small></a>. He succeeded Peter of Tewkesbury as provincial minister
about 1256<a name='fna_851' id='fna_851' href='#f_851'><small>[851]</small></a>. His friendship with Adam Marsh lasted to the end of the
latter’s life<a name='fna_852' id='fna_852' href='#f_852'><small>[852]</small></a>: feeling that his last days were approaching, Adam
begged Bonaventura, then General, to send to him John of Stamford, the
English Provincial, who was at this time (1257), apparently abroad<a name='fna_853' id='fna_853' href='#f_853'><small>[853]</small></a>.
As Provincial he procured an endowment (20<i>s.</i> per annum) for St. Owen’s
Church in London, the parish in which the Minorites then had their
house<a name='fna_854' id='fna_854' href='#f_854'><small>[854]</small></a>. He is said to have died in 1264,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> but there is no good
authority for the statement<a name='fna_855' id='fna_855' href='#f_855'><small>[855]</small></a>. He was buried at Lynn, with which place
he seems to have had some previous connexion: Brewer calls him warden of
Lynn<a name='fna_856' id='fna_856' href='#f_856'><small>[856]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Martin</b> is mentioned in two letters from Adam Marsh to ‘W., Minister of
England’ as warden of Oxford; but the superscription is untrustworthy and
the date of the letters uncertain<a name='fna_857' id='fna_857' href='#f_857'><small>[857]</small></a>. This Martin may have been
identical with the ‘Frater Martinus senex’ (mentioned by Eccleston), who
established the convent at Shrewsbury, and delighted in the recollection
of the hardships and poverty which he had then experienced<a name='fna_858' id='fna_858' href='#f_858'><small>[858]</small></a>. A Martin
de Barton, who was also known to Eccleston, and had often seen St.
Francis, came to England in the early years of the Order, and was
afterwards vicar of the English Provincial and filled many other
offices<a name='fna_859' id='fna_859' href='#f_859'><small>[859]</small></a>. When custodian of York, Martin de Barton enforced the
strictest poverty, only allowing so many friars to live in any place, as
could be supported by mendicancy alone without incurring debts<a name='fna_860' id='fna_860' href='#f_860'><small>[860]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Adam of Warminster</b> was warden in 1269; he took part in a controversy with
the Dominicans at Oxford in that year, defending his Order against the
charge of being ‘receivers of money<a name='fna_861' id='fna_861' href='#f_861'><small>[861]</small></a>.’</p>

<p><b>John de Codyngton</b> was warden in 1300, when he received license from the
Bishop to hear confessions in the Archdeaconry of Oxford<a name='fna_862' id='fna_862' href='#f_862'><small>[862]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John de Okehampton</b> was warden in 1340; all that is known of him will be
found in the Appendix B.</p>

<p><b>Richard Clyff</b> was custodian in 1465 and 1466. In the latter year he sued
John Broghton, sheriff of Kent for a royal debt. He was sometime
vice-warden of London and was buried in the church of the Minorites
there<a name='fna_863' id='fna_863' href='#f_863'><small>[863]</small></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span><b>Richard Salford</b> was warden in 1488 and 1489; he recovered debts from Sir
John Paston, sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and Sir Edmund Bedyngfeld,
sheriff of the same counties; the records of these suits contain the only
notices of him now remaining<a name='fna_864' id='fna_864' href='#f_864'><small>[864]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>William Vavasor</b> was studying at Oxford and transcribing philosophical
treatises in 1490 and 1491<a name='fna_865' id='fna_865' href='#f_865'><small>[865]</small></a>. He incepted as D.D. in 1500, and was
warden of the convent about the same time<a name='fna_866' id='fna_866' href='#f_866'><small>[866]</small></a>. In Thomas Cromwell’s list
of learned persons not living in Oxford (<span class="smcaplc">A. D.</span> 1531) is the name of ‘Dr.
Vavysor, Grey Friar at...’<a name='fna_867' id='fna_867' href='#f_867'><small>[867]</small></a>. At the dissolution he was warden of the
Grey Friars at York<a name='fna_868' id='fna_868' href='#f_868'><small>[868]</small></a>, and was one of the few Mendicants who received a
pension; the amount was £5 a year<a name='fna_869' id='fna_869' href='#f_869'><small>[869]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Robert Burton</b> was warden on April 12, 1508, when he applied to the
Chancellor’s Court to recover a debt.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Eodem die dedimus terminum domino Joanni Gardener principali aule

&amp;c.<a name='fna_870' id='fna_870' href='#f_870'><small>[870]</small></a></p></div>

<p>As B.D. he supplicated for D.D. on March 8th, 1507/8 after studying for
twenty years at Oxford and Cambridge, preaching two University sermons at
Oxford, and six at Paul’s Cross, &amp;c.; the grace was conceded on condition
that he should respond once more<a name='fna_871' id='fna_871' href='#f_871'><small>[871]</small></a>. Afterwards he became regent of the
Franciscan Schools in London. The register of the Grey Friars, London,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span><b>Walter Goodfield</b> was warden shortly before 1513; as warden he leased one

Register<a name='fna_874' id='fna_874' href='#f_874'><small>[874]</small></a>, it appears that on Nov. 27, 1506, he supplicated to be
admitted to opponency and to read the sentences, after studying twelve
years in logic, philosophy, and theology; on May 10, 1507, in making the
same supplication, he stated that he had studied the same subjects
fourteen years. He was admitted to oppose on Dec. 10, 1507. On June 3,
1508, he supplicated as B.D. for D.D.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘This grace was granted on condition that he has studied twelve years
in logic, philosophy, and theology, and that he proceed before Easter,
and that he preach once ‘<i>preter formam</i>,’ after taking his degree,

<p>On March 19, 1509/10, he was allowed to count a sermon to be preached on
Ash Wednesday as his examinatory sermon. On May 12, 1510, he was licensed
in theology. On June 27, 1510, he was dispensed ‘<i>pro suis lecturis
minutis</i>.’ On July 1, he was admitted D.D.; on Oct. 28, 1510, he was with
three others appointed a judge to examine a sentence passed on Thomas
Foster by the commissary<a name='fna_875' id='fna_875' href='#f_875'><small>[875]</small></a>; and on Dec. 10, he was dispensed from his
necessary regency, possibly owing to his duties as warden. He seems to
have become warden of the London convent after this<a name='fna_876' id='fna_876' href='#f_876'><small>[876]</small></a>. He died on the
6th of May, 1521, and was buried in the chapel of All Saints, in the Grey
Friars Church, London<a name='fna_877' id='fna_877' href='#f_877'><small>[877]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John Harvey</b> succeeded Goodfield as warden; he held the office in Feb.
1513/4<a name='fna_878' id='fna_878' href='#f_878'><small>[878]</small></a>, Feb. 1514/5<a name='fna_879' id='fna_879' href='#f_879'><small>[879]</small></a>, and probably for many years afterwards. He
had ceased to be warden in 1529, when he was required by the vice-warden
or sub-warden John Bacheler, in the name of the then warden, to answer
certain charges made against him respecting his administration<a name='fna_880' id='fna_880' href='#f_880'><small>[880]</small></a>. The
following details are known about his scholastic career; he was admitted
to oppose in theology Dec. 6, 1514, and admitted B.D. on Jan. 20, 1514/5;
he was still B.D. in 1529; one of the same name took the degree of B. Can.
L. on April 3, 1530, but he is not described as a friar<a name='fna_881' id='fna_881' href='#f_881'><small>[881]</small></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span><b>Edward Baskerfild</b> was probably the immediate successor of John Harvey. In

<p>In Oct. 1532, he was dispensed from his necessary regency. In 1533 we find
him at Exeter, trying to extract from Thomas Benet a recantation of his
heresies<a name='fna_887' id='fna_887' href='#f_887'><small>[887]</small></a>.</p>

<p>He acted as deputy of the commisary, or vice-chancellor, in 1534, 1535,
1536, and 1537<a name='fna_888' id='fna_888' href='#f_888'><small>[888]</small></a>. In this capacity he sometimes held his court in the
Franciscan convent, as, for instance, when investigating the charges of
immorality against Friar Arthur<a name='fna_889' id='fna_889' href='#f_889'><small>[889]</small></a>. His pecuniary position seems to have
improved: he kept a horse in 1534<a name='fna_890' id='fna_890' href='#f_890'><small>[890]</small></a>, and in 1537, one Robert Symon was
admitted to the privileges of the University as servant of Dr.
Baskerfild<a name='fna_891' id='fna_891' href='#f_891'><small>[891]</small></a>.</p>

<p>At the dissolution he made his peace with the visitors by causing his
house to surrender at once<a name='fna_892' id='fna_892' href='#f_892'><small>[892]</small></a>. Dr. London sent him to Thomas Cromwell
(Aug. 31, 1538), to obtain the ‘capacities’ for the Oxford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> friars, and
begged Cromwell to allow him to live in Oxford ‘altho he wer benefycyd.’

<p>he possessed information concerning the friars in London and elsewhere
which might be useful to the King’s agents, and which he was willing to
impart to them. He appears to have accompanied Dr. London on his
visitation after the dissolution of the friars at Oxford, and we find him

of the Black Friars of Derby<a name='fna_893' id='fna_893' href='#f_893'><small>[893]</small></a>. The name is spelt in a variety of ways,

<p class="title">LECTORS OR REGENT MASTERS OF THE FRANCISCANS.</p>


<p>The following sixty-seven names are classed together under a separate
heading simply because they are found in a list in an old manuscript. The
list is evidently intended to include all the Regent Masters of the Friars
Minors at Oxford<a name='fna_894' id='fna_894' href='#f_894'><small>[894]</small></a> in chronological order; it seems to break off about
the year 1350. Whether it is complete up to that date may be doubted; but
no contemporary, or nearly contemporary, notice has been found of any
Friar Minor Regent in Theology or D.D. of Oxford before 1351, whose name
does not occur in this list<a name='fna_895' id='fna_895' href='#f_895'><small>[895]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The list is found in two MSS:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. British Museum; Cotton Nero A IX, fol. 77 a-b, in Eccleston’s
Chronicle. Names 1-5 are in the same hand as the rest of the MS.; 6-21 in
a hand rather larger but not perceptibly later. On the reverse of the
leaf, they are continued in a later fourteenth century hand which ends at
the 58th name; then 59-66 have been added not much later (the ink has
faded a good deal in this part); the last name is in a later hand,
probably fifteenth century.</p>

<p>II. Phillipps, MS. 3119, fol. 76 (at Thirlestaine House). Names 1-21 are
in the same hand as the MS., i.e. the text of Eccleston’s Chronicle;
another scribe has added names 22-49 inclusive; then the names are
continued in another hand to Laurence Briton, where the list ends. This
MS. omits Henry Cruche and Walter de Chauton, so that Laurence Briton is
called the 53rd master instead of the 55th.</p>

bishop’s service<a name='fna_899' id='fna_899' href='#f_899'><small>[899]</small></a>. Adam’s uncle, Richard de Marisco, Bishop of Durham,
from 1217 to 1226, gave him a living near Wearmouth, which he held for
three years<a name='fna_900' id='fna_900' href='#f_900'><small>[900]</small></a>, and bequeathed to him his library in 1226<a name='fna_901' id='fna_901' href='#f_901'><small>[901]</small></a>. At this
time Adam was a Master, probably of Arts. Soon afterwards, at the
instigation of his friend and pupil<a name='fna_902' id='fna_902' href='#f_902'><small>[902]</small></a> Adam of Oxford, who had recently
become a Minorite, he gave up ‘all worldly greatness and a large
income<a name='fna_903' id='fna_903' href='#f_903'><small>[903]</small></a>’ to enter the Franciscan Order at Worcester, ‘through zeal for
greater poverty<a name='fna_904' id='fna_904' href='#f_904'><small>[904]</small></a>.’ He is said to have been appointed by the General
Chapter <i>socius</i> of St. Anthony of Padua, the first theological student in
the Order. The two then proceeded, according to the same authority, to
study under the Abbat of St. Andrew’s at Vercelli, where they made such
progress in five years that the Abbat confessed that his pupils had become
his teachers<a name='fna_905' id='fna_905' href='#f_905'><small>[905]</small></a>. In 1230 St. Anthony and Adam Marsh are said to have
headed the opposition to the relaxations which Elias was attempting to
bring into the Order<a name='fna_906' id='fna_906' href='#f_906'><small>[906]</small></a>; but this tradition is probably unfounded;
Eccleston says nothing about it<a name='fna_907' id='fna_907' href='#f_907'><small>[907]</small></a>. After his entry into the Order, Adam
probably resided for the most part at Oxford, where Grostete was then
lecturing to the Franciscans. Wood asserts that the latter presided at his
inception and made the customary speech in praise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> of the inceptor at the
ceremony<a name='fna_908' id='fna_908' href='#f_908'><small>[908]</small></a>; but the statement, though probable enough in itself, lacks
authority and seems to have originated from a confusion between Adam and
Robert Marsh<a name='fna_909' id='fna_909' href='#f_909'><small>[909]</small></a>: it is not unlikely that Adam received his theological
degree abroad. There is no direct evidence of his having lectured on
theology to the friars at Oxford before 1252<a name='fna_910' id='fna_910' href='#f_910'><small>[910]</small></a>, but there can be no
doubt that he began to do so not later than 1247 (when Thomas Wallensis
was elected Bishop of St. David’s), and he probably delivered lectures
long before. He was certainly before this time one of the recognised
leaders of the English Franciscans<a name='fna_911' id='fna_911' href='#f_911'><small>[911]</small></a>. He was on a commission of three
elected by the English province to report on the Rule when Haymo was
general (1239-1244), and recommended that no change should be made in the
statutes of St. Francis<a name='fna_912' id='fna_912' href='#f_912'><small>[912]</small></a>. He wrote a solemn exhortation in the name of
the English Minorites to Boniface of Savoy on his consecration to the
Archbishopric of Canterbury in 1245<a name='fna_913' id='fna_913' href='#f_913'><small>[913]</small></a>. William of Nottingham submitted
to him the names of three friars from whom he was to select one to act as
Vicar in the Provincial Minister’s absence (1250?)<a name='fna_914' id='fna_914' href='#f_914'><small>[914]</small></a>. In his latter
years he was one of the foremost men in the church. At the instance of the
Archbishop of Canterbury and for his use, he wrote an address to the Pope
on the occasion of Henry III taking the cross (1250)<a name='fna_915' id='fna_915' href='#f_915'><small>[915]</small></a>. He addressed a
long letter of advice to St. Sewalus on his appointment to the
Archbishopric of York in 1255<a name='fna_916' id='fna_916' href='#f_916'><small>[916]</small></a>. In the same year he was nominated by
Alexander IV to settle a dispute between the Bishop and the Prior and
Convent of Winchester<a name='fna_917' id='fna_917' href='#f_917'><small>[917]</small></a>. He was on a Papal commission to try a cause
between the King and the Bishop of St. David’s, and between the same
bishop and the Abbat of Gloucester<a name='fna_918' id='fna_918' href='#f_918'><small>[918]</small></a>, and on another commission
appointed to examine the claims of Richard de Wiche to canonization<a name='fna_919' id='fna_919' href='#f_919'><small>[919]</small></a>.
He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> supported Grostete in his revolt against the scandalous nepotism of
Innocent IV<a name='fna_920' id='fna_920' href='#f_920'><small>[920]</small></a>. At Oxford his character, learning, and friendship with
the great, gave him a very important position, and he acted as spokesman
now of the Franciscans, now of the whole University<a name='fna_921' id='fna_921' href='#f_921'><small>[921]</small></a>. His fame was
European, and Grostete was afraid that the Parisians would secure him to
supply the place of Alexander of Hales (1245)<a name='fna_922' id='fna_922' href='#f_922'><small>[922]</small></a>. Among his
correspondents and friends were many of the leading men of the age, such
as Walter de Cantilupe<a name='fna_923' id='fna_923' href='#f_923'><small>[923]</small></a>, Richard de Wiche, Walter de Merton, Richard
Earl of Cornwall, John of Parma, and Bonaventura. He assisted the
Archbishop of Canterbury in his visitation, and accompanied Grostete to
the Council of Lyons. At one time he is wanted to attend the Parliament at
London<a name='fna_924' id='fna_924' href='#f_924'><small>[924]</small></a>, at another he is summoned by the Queen to Reading, to treat
of ‘matters touching the King and his heirs<a name='fna_925' id='fna_925' href='#f_925'><small>[925]</small></a>.’ He incurred the royal
displeasure by an outspoken sermon at Court (Oct. 1250)<a name='fna_926' id='fna_926' href='#f_926'><small>[926]</small></a>; but his
advice was asked and listened to by the King who afterwards called him his
father<a name='fna_927' id='fna_927' href='#f_927'><small>[927]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘When the Jews ... had transgressed against the peace of the kingdom,
so that both by the judgment of the King and the princes of the land
they were judged worthy of death, he alone resisted their arguments
and forbade that they should be put to death<a name='fna_928' id='fna_928' href='#f_928'><small>[928]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>In 1247 he was sent abroad with the Prior of the Dominicans on the King’s
business, and forty marks were granted to buy horses and harness for the
ambassadors<a name='fna_929' id='fna_929' href='#f_929'><small>[929]</small></a>. In 1257 he was sent with Walter de Cantilupe, Bishop of
Worcester, on a similar mission, his expenses being paid out of the
treasury<a name='fna_930' id='fna_930' href='#f_930'><small>[930]</small></a>. He was no less intimate with the Earl of Leicester than
with the Bishop of Lincoln. He lectures Eleanor de Montfort on her duties
as a mother and wife, and on her excess in dress<a name='fna_931' id='fna_931' href='#f_931'><small>[931]</small></a>. He speaks equally
plainly to Simon de Montfort.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Better is a patient man than a strong man,’ he writes to the
hot-headed earl, ‘and he who can rule his own temper than he who
storms a city<a name='fna_932' id='fna_932' href='#f_932'><small>[932]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The friar took a keen interest in his friend’s great deeds, recognised his
noble qualities, and the value of his efforts ‘to purge, illuminate, and
sanctify the church of God,’ and looked to him as the guardian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> of the
public weal<a name='fna_933' id='fna_933' href='#f_933'><small>[933]</small></a>. He encouraged the Earl to go forward in his thankless
task of saving Gascony, and tried to win the King over to his side<a name='fna_934' id='fna_934' href='#f_934'><small>[934]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘If,’ he writes to the Earl in 1250<a name='fna_935' id='fna_935' href='#f_935'><small>[935]</small></a>, ‘you have received the
answers of broken friendship and feigned affection, what else are you
now suffering than what you before expected? The clear circumspection
of your wisdom will remember, in how many conferences, after repeated
and careful examination, we drummed into each other’s ears the
execrable shamelessness of seductive cunning, such as we now see;
although, considering the trustworthiness of courageous fidelity, your
wisdom did not think proper to decline the danger of a truly grand
exploit, for the imminent suspicion merely of some stupendous
dishonesty.’</p></div>

<p>With all his other occupations Adam Marsh did not neglect the poor and
oppressed; he begs Grostete to assist two poor scholars relatives of the
bishop; he writes to Thomas de Anesti on behalf of an able and honest
schoolmaster who is in want of the very necessaries of life; a weeping
widow brings her troubles to him, sure of sympathy and help<a name='fna_936' id='fna_936' href='#f_936'><small>[936]</small></a>. His
health gave way under the strain of his manifold duties and the severe
discipline of his Order: he suffered from weakness of the eyes and other
infirmities<a name='fna_937' id='fna_937' href='#f_937'><small>[937]</small></a>. In 1253 he lost his lifelong friend Grostete, who
bequeathed his library to the Oxford Franciscans out of love for Adam
Marsh<a name='fna_938' id='fna_938' href='#f_938'><small>[938]</small></a>. In 1256 the King and Archbishop of Canterbury tried to force
him into the bishopric of Ely; his rival Hugh Balsham who had been elected
by the chapter appealed to Rome and obtained a decision in his favour on
Oct. 6, 1257. His candidature, probably none of his own seeking, seems to
have laid the friar open to a charge of worldly ambition, which must have
embittered his last days<a name='fna_939' id='fna_939' href='#f_939'><small>[939]</small></a>. Feeling the end approaching, he wrote to
Bonaventura to send the Provincial John of Stamford,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘by whom, through God’s blessing, I may be directed through things
transitory and my thoughts raised to things eternal<a name='fna_940' id='fna_940' href='#f_940'><small>[940]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>On Dec. 23, 1257, he was ordered abroad by the King<a name='fna_941' id='fna_941' href='#f_941'><small>[941]</small></a>. He probably died
on Nov. 18<a name='fna_942' id='fna_942' href='#f_942'><small>[942]</small></a>, 1258, and was buried next to
Grostete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> at Lincoln<a name='fna_943' id='fna_943' href='#f_943'><small>[943]</small></a>.
Besides the treatise mentioned below, none of his works remain<a name='fna_944' id='fna_944' href='#f_944'><small>[944]</small></a> except
the letters, which, stilted and obscure in style, do not justify the title
of <i>Doctor illustris</i>, with which subsequent generations honoured
him<a name='fna_945' id='fna_945' href='#f_945'><small>[945]</small></a>. His reputation as a philosopher and theologian must rest on the
evidence of his contemporaries, and on the greatness of the school which
he did so much to found. Matthew Paris calls him ‘<i>literatus</i><a name='fna_946' id='fna_946' href='#f_946'><small>[946]</small></a>.’
Grostete found him</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘a true friend and faithful counsellor, respecting truth not
vanity,’&mdash;‘a wise man and a prudent, and fervent in zeal for the
salvation of souls<a name='fna_947' id='fna_947' href='#f_947'><small>[947]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>His most famous pupil Roger Bacon had nothing but praise and admiration
for his master, who like Grostete was ‘perfect in all wisdom<a name='fna_948' id='fna_948' href='#f_948'><small>[948]</small></a>.’</p>

<p>2. <b>Ralph de Colebruge</b> was the second Franciscan master who lectured at
Oxford. He entered the Order while regent in theology at Paris, where he
won some fame; after finishing his course of lectures, he was appointed by
the General of the Order to rule in theology at Oxford, probably before
1250; he was still a novice when he entered on his duties at Oxford<a name='fna_949' id='fna_949' href='#f_949'><small>[949]</small></a>.</p>

<p>3. <b>Eustace de Normaneville</b>, probably took the Franciscan habit at Oxford
about 1250 or before<a name='fna_950' id='fna_950' href='#f_950'><small>[950]</small></a>. His conversion was of peculiar importance to
the Order,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>‘because he was noble and rich, and had laudably ruled in arts and
decrees, and had been Chancellor of Oxford<a name='fna_951' id='fna_951' href='#f_951'><small>[951]</small></a>, and was about to
incept in theology.’</p></div>

<p>It must have been soon after his entry that the friars at Norwich asked
him to become their lecturer. Adam Marsh was deputed by the Provincial to
make the proposal to him. Eustace refused the honour on the plea of
ill-health and ‘unprepared aptitude of mind<a name='fna_952' id='fna_952' href='#f_952'><small>[952]</small></a>.’ Eccleston mentions him
as the third who lectured at the Oxford Grey Friars as a master<a name='fna_953' id='fna_953' href='#f_953'><small>[953]</small></a>. He
was afterwards sent to Cambridge and was the third regent master of the
Franciscans there<a name='fna_954' id='fna_954' href='#f_954'><small>[954]</small></a>.</p>

<p>4. <b>Thomas of York</b> (1253) is first mentioned in a letter of Adam Marsh
written at Lyons, 1245; the writer sends for various books, among which is</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the chapter of the First Prophecy (Abbat Joachim?) which the beloved
brother in Christ, Thomas of York had<a name='fna_955' id='fna_955' href='#f_955'><small>[955]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Soon afterwards we find him consulting with Adam, Grostete, and the Vicar
of the Provincial Minister, about sending English friars to Denmark<a name='fna_956' id='fna_956' href='#f_956'><small>[956]</small></a>.
He wrote to Adam about the defeat of St. Louis and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> the Crusaders in 1250,
and Adam sent the letter on to Grostete<a name='fna_957' id='fna_957' href='#f_957'><small>[957]</small></a>. About the same time Adam
remonstrates with him for breaking his promises, especially for omitting
to send him ‘the table of the Trinity’ (? <i>tabula trinitatis</i>)<a name='fna_958' id='fna_958' href='#f_958'><small>[958]</small></a>.
Another letter to him from Adam Marsh refers to the anger of the King
against Simon de Montfort, whose friendship Thomas seems to have enjoyed
and whose party he no doubt supported. Perhaps it was before 1250 that
Adam advised the Provincial Minister to instruct Thomas,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘that he should apply himself to the study of Holy Scriptures by
attending the lectures of the learned and investigating their
writings,’</p></div>

<p>with a view to his eventually becoming lecturer to the Grey Friars at
Oxford; failing this, the writer hints that Thomas would probably be
summoned abroad<a name='fna_959' id='fna_959' href='#f_959'><small>[959]</small></a>. In the same letter he refers to his ‘youthful age.’
At the beginning of 1253<a name='fna_960' id='fna_960' href='#f_960'><small>[960]</small></a> Thomas of York was presented to incept in
theology at Oxford, objections were raised on the ground that he had not
taken a degree in Arts. Eventually he was allowed to incept, but a statute
was passed to regulate the conduct of the University on similar occasions
in the future. The details of the controversy are given elsewhere<a name='fna_961' id='fna_961' href='#f_961'><small>[961]</small></a>.
The vesperies took place on Thursday, March 13th, and the inception on the
following day, under the presidency of Friar Peter de Manners, apparently
a Dominican; Adam Marsh, who as master of the inceptor would naturally
have presided, left Oxford on March 12th. Thomas of York now became
lecturer to the Oxford Franciscans<a name='fna_962' id='fna_962' href='#f_962'><small>[962]</small></a>. He was afterwards sent to
Cambridge and occurs as the sixth in the list of ‘Masters of the Friars
Minors’ there<a name='fna_963' id='fna_963' href='#f_963'><small>[963]</small></a>. Adam Marsh writes to him in the most affectionate
terms and speaks highly of his learning, and the brightness of his
intellect<a name='fna_964' id='fna_964' href='#f_964'><small>[964]</small></a>; he describes him to Grostete as an earnest, discreet, and
benevolent man, filled with a heavenly zeal for the salvation of
souls<a name='fna_965' id='fna_965' href='#f_965'><small>[965]</small></a>. According to the <i>Catalogus illustrium Franciscanorum</i> he
wrote a commentary on Ecclesiastes<a name='fna_966' id='fna_966' href='#f_966'><small>[966]</small></a>.</p>

<p>5. <b>Richard Rufus of Cornwall</b><a name='fna_967' id='fna_967' href='#f_967'><small>[967]</small></a> was a Master, probably of Arts, when he
became a Minorite at Paris</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘at the time when Friar Elias threw the whole Order into confusion’
(c. 1238).</p></div>

<p>He came to England (where he made his profession) while the trial of the
Minister-General was yet pending in the Roman Court<a name='fna_968' id='fna_968' href='#f_968'><small>[968]</small></a>. He is mentioned
as speaking at a chapter at Oxford soon after coming to England&mdash;probably
either the visitatorial chapter or the chapter held to protest against the
visitor’s conduct in 1238<a name='fna_969' id='fna_969' href='#f_969'><small>[969]</small></a>. Soon after 1250 he received a command from
the General to go to Paris as lecturer, but he seems to have obtained
leave to continue his studies at Oxford owing to his weak health<a name='fna_970' id='fna_970' href='#f_970'><small>[970]</small></a>. He
probably lectured on the sentences as B.D. about this time. But soon
afterwards, ‘<i>ob vehementiores perturbationum occasiones</i><a name='fna_971' id='fna_971' href='#f_971'><small>[971]</small></a>,’ in Adam
Marsh’s words, he formed the ‘inexorable resolution’ of going to France in
accordance with the General’s permission: and Adam in the name of the
other friars, requested the Provincial to facilitate his departure by
providing him with suitable companions and the necessary manuscripts<a name='fna_972' id='fna_972' href='#f_972'><small>[972]</small></a>.
Early in 1253 again, Adam writes to the Provincial:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘I beg you to look out for some one competent to act as secretary to
Friar Richard of Cornwall<a name='fna_973' id='fna_973' href='#f_973'><small>[973]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>It may then be inferred that he went to Paris in 1253, where, according to
Eccleston,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘he gave cursory lectures on the sentences and was judged a great and
admirable philosopher<a name='fna_974' id='fna_974' href='#f_974'><small>[974]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>After lecturing in Paris, he returned to Oxford, it appears, and became
regent-master of the friars (c. 1255?)<a name='fna_975' id='fna_975' href='#f_975'><small>[975]</small></a>. It was here that he developed
the ‘errors,’ the verbal subtleties, which Roger Bacon so unsparingly
denounced. Writing in 1292, Bacon says<a name='fna_976' id='fna_976' href='#f_976'><small>[976]</small></a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Et optime novi auctorem<a name='fna_977' id='fna_977' href='#f_977'><small>[977]</small></a> pessimum et stultissimum istorum

<p>Adam Marsh, though in somewhat general terms, gives a far more flattering
account of Richard<a name='fna_981' id='fna_981' href='#f_981'><small>[981]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Martin de Sancta Cruce, Master of the Hospital of Sherbourne, bequeathed
to him in his will dated November, 1259, <i>unum habitum integrum</i>, and a
copy of the Canonical Epistles<a name='fna_982' id='fna_982' href='#f_982'><small>[982]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Assisi MS. 176 contains a compilation ascribed by a note in a late hand to
‘Master Richard Rufus of England;’ the volume was in the possession of the
friars at Assisi in 1373, consists of 226 leaves, and seems to contain
more than one treatise: it is not rubricated.</p>

<p>6. <b>John Wallensis</b> was B.D. of Oxford before he entered the Order<a name='fna_983' id='fna_983' href='#f_983'><small>[983]</small></a>. He
must have become D.D. and regent master of the Franciscan schools at
Oxford before 1260<a name='fna_984' id='fna_984' href='#f_984'><small>[984]</small></a>. It was probably after this that he went as
lecturer to Paris, where he was honoured with the title of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> <i>Arbor
Vitae</i><a name='fna_985' id='fna_985' href='#f_985'><small>[985]</small></a>, and where he was
buried<a name='fna_986' id='fna_986' href='#f_986'><small>[986]</small></a>. But before his death he was
again in England. In October, 1282, ‘Friar John Wallensis, S.T.D.,’ was
sent by Archbishop Peckham as ambassador to the insurgent Welsh<a name='fna_987' id='fna_987' href='#f_987'><small>[987]</small></a>. In

described as ‘sometime reader at Oxford<a name='fna_1002' id='fna_1002' href='#f_1002'><small>[1002]</small></a>.’ According to Blomefield,
he was warden of Norwich and died about 1270<a name='fna_1003' id='fna_1003' href='#f_1003'><small>[1003]</small></a>. His theological works,

<p>who composed a <i>Summa de Sacramentis</i> in 1261<a name='fna_1009' id='fna_1009' href='#f_1009'><small>[1009]</small></a>. He afterwards became

<p>9. <b>William of Heddele</b> (Durham or Northumberland?) is mentioned by Adam
Marsh in a letter to the Provincial, c. 1253, as ‘your desirable son Friar
William de Hedele<a name='fna_1013' id='fna_1013' href='#f_1013'><small>[1013]</small></a>.’ We know from another source that Heddele was
reader at Oxford in 1269, when he took part in the controversy with the
Friars Preachers<a name='fna_1014' id='fna_1014' href='#f_1014'><small>[1014]</small></a>. When Prince Edward went to the Holy Land,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘he took with him,’ in the words of the so-called Lanercost
Chronicle<a name='fna_1015' id='fna_1015' href='#f_1015'><small>[1015]</small></a>, ‘the reader and master of the Friars Minors at
Oxford, Friar William de Hedley, a man beloved of God and in favour
with men.’</p></div>

<p>The chronicler puts these events in the year 1266. Edward took the cross
in 1268 and sailed in 1270. Friar William died on the outward voyage in
the sea of Greece:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘his corpse,’ continues the same authority ‘being given to the waves
as the custom is, followed the course of the ships for three days,
until, at Edward’s command, it was taken again into the vessel and
afterwards committed to the earth.’</p></div>

<p>10. <b>Thomas de Bungay</b> (Suffolk) has been traditionally associated with
Roger Bacon and regarded as a wizard by later generations. Very little is
known of him. He perhaps entered the Order at Norwich. He lectured as D.D.
in the Franciscan convent at Oxford about 1270; he seems like Roger to
have attached a great importance to mathematics and may have held his
views on the value of natural science and of induction. He lectured
afterwards at Cambridge, being the fifteenth in the list of Franciscan
masters there. He was the eighth English Provincial Minister, and was
succeeded by Peckham, probably in 1275. He was buried at
Northampton<a name='fna_1016' id='fna_1016' href='#f_1016'><small>[1016]</small></a>.</p>

<p>According to the Catalogue of Illustrious Franciscans he wrote a

<p>11. <b>John Peckham</b> was born in Sussex and received his earliest education in
the Priory of Lewes<a name='fna_1018' id='fna_1018' href='#f_1018'><small>[1018]</small></a>. He took the Franciscan vows about 1250<a name='fna_1019' id='fna_1019' href='#f_1019'><small>[1019]</small></a>;
he was then tutor to the nephew of Master H. of Anjou, perhaps in the
University of Paris, but was probably for the time being residing at
Oxford<a name='fna_1020' id='fna_1020' href='#f_1020'><small>[1020]</small></a>. On entering the Order he resigned the tutorship. Adam Marsh
calls him ‘<i>Dominus Johannes de Pescham Scholaris</i>;’ he may therefore
either have had no degree at this time, or that of bachelor. He appears to
have spent some time at Oxford, as in later years he expresses his
gratitude for the training he received in the Franciscan convent of that
University<a name='fna_1021' id='fna_1021' href='#f_1021'><small>[1021]</small></a>. He then returned to France, studied under Bonaventura,
and took the Doctor’s degree at Paris, where he ruled in theology<a name='fna_1022' id='fna_1022' href='#f_1022'><small>[1022]</small></a>.
Among his pupils was St. Thomas of Cantilupe, Bishop of Hereford<a name='fna_1023' id='fna_1023' href='#f_1023'><small>[1023]</small></a>. At
Paris too he came in contact with Thomas Aquinas and probably attended his
lectures. He was present when the latter submitted his doctrine about the
‘Unity of form’ to the judgment of the masters in theology;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘we alone,’ the Archbishop wrote afterwards, ‘stood by him, defending
him to the best of our power, saving the truth<a name='fna_1024' id='fna_1024' href='#f_1024'><small>[1024]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He was at Paris during the troublous times which followed William of St.
Amour’s attack on the Mendicants, and wrote a defence of the latter<a name='fna_1025' id='fna_1025' href='#f_1025'><small>[1025]</small></a>.
He returned to England probably about 1270 or soon after, and was admitted
at Oxford to the same degree as he held at Paris<a name='fna_1026' id='fna_1026' href='#f_1026'><small>[1026]</small></a>. He now became
lecturer to the Franciscans. On May 2, 1275, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> was with Friar Oliver de
Encourt Prior of the Dominicans, appointed, by the King’s writ, to decide
a suit in the University which had long been under consideration in the
Chancellor’s court<a name='fna_1027' id='fna_1027' href='#f_1027'><small>[1027]</small></a>. It was probably soon after this that he was
elected ninth Provincial Minister and confirmed by Bonaventura<a name='fna_1028' id='fna_1028' href='#f_1028'><small>[1028]</small></a>. He
did not hold this office long, being in 1277, summoned by the Pope
(Nicholas III?) to lecture on theology in the schools of the Papal Court
at Rome<a name='fna_1029' id='fna_1029' href='#f_1029'><small>[1029]</small></a>. After lecturing here for something less than two years, he
was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury by Papal bull in January 1279, and
consecrated by the Pope in the following March<a name='fna_1030' id='fna_1030' href='#f_1030'><small>[1030]</small></a>. His official
connexion with the Order did not cease; he was deputed by the Pope</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘protector of the privileges of the Order of Minors in England,’</p></div>

<p>and frequently used his powers for the benefit of the Franciscans<a name='fna_1031' id='fna_1031' href='#f_1031'><small>[1031]</small></a>.
His relations to the Oxford Franciscans, as well as his condemnation of
erroneous doctrines at the University, have already been noticed. While
enforcing to the uttermost his legal rights, the Archbishop evinced a
special solicitude for the poor, feeding them in time of famine,
remonstrating with covetous abbats and careless landlords<a name='fna_1032' id='fna_1032' href='#f_1032'><small>[1032]</small></a>. He
himself is said to have travelled on foot, to have surpassed all in
watchings and fastings and prayer, to have used none but vile garments and
bedding&mdash;in fine to have lived as became one who held perfection to
consist in the contempt of riches and the search for truth<a name='fna_1033' id='fna_1033' href='#f_1033'><small>[1033]</small></a>. He died
on December 8, 1292, and was buried ‘among the monks’ of Canterbury near
Becket’s tomb<a name='fna_1034' id='fna_1034' href='#f_1034'><small>[1034]</small></a>. His heart was buried in the choir behind the High
Altar at the Grey Friars of London<a name='fna_1035' id='fna_1035' href='#f_1035'><small>[1035]</small></a>. He named as his executors the
Friars Minors of Paris<a name='fna_1036' id='fna_1036' href='#f_1036'><small>[1036]</small></a>. The Dominican Nicholas Trivet sums up his
character in these words<a name='fna_1037' id='fna_1037' href='#f_1037'><small>[1037]</small></a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘He was a zealous promoter of the interests of his Order, an excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>maker of songs, of pompous manner and speech, but of kind and
thoroughly liberal heart.’</p></div>

<p>A careful and valuable account of his works will be found in Mr. Trice
Martin’s preface to Peckham’s Register, Vol. III<a name='fna_1038' id='fna_1038' href='#f_1038'><small>[1038]</small></a>.</p>

<p>12. <b>Henry de Apeltre</b> was the twelfth reader at Oxford, and seventeenth
master of the Friars Minors at Cambridge. Nothing more is known about
him<a name='fna_1039' id='fna_1039' href='#f_1039'><small>[1039]</small></a>.</p>

<p>13. <b>Robert Cross</b> or <b>Crouche</b><a name='fna_1040' id='fna_1040' href='#f_1040'><small>[1040]</small></a> (de Cruce) must have lectured at Oxford
about 1280. In April of that year Peckham forbade an Oxford Dominican to
visit a certain ‘college of women’ on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> of grave suspicion, on the
accusation of Friar Robert de Cruce<a name='fna_1041' id='fna_1041' href='#f_1041'><small>[1041]</small></a>. Leland states that he was
immersed in philosophical studies to an advanced age, and when at last he
betook himself to theology he showed greater skill in investigating
speculative subtleties than in exploring the literal sense; the statement
might be made with equal truth of most of the scholastics. He became
Provincial Minister soon after 1280. The successor of John Peckham, Hugh
of Bath, died within a short time of his appointment, and was succeeded by
Robert Cross as eleventh minister<a name='fna_1042' id='fna_1042' href='#f_1042'><small>[1042]</small></a>. He held the office in June 1284,
when he obtained for the English Minorites exemption from the payment of a
custom due to the King from all who passed to or from the Continent by the
port of Dover<a name='fna_1043' id='fna_1043' href='#f_1043'><small>[1043]</small></a>. In Sept. of the same year he held a chapter of the
English Franciscans<a name='fna_1044' id='fna_1044' href='#f_1044'><small>[1044]</small></a>; and in March 1285, he represented the English
Province at the General Chapter of Milan<a name='fna_1045' id='fna_1045' href='#f_1045'><small>[1045]</small></a>. He may have resigned the
dignity at this Chapter; on Oct. 31, 1285, Peckham addresses a letter to
‘W., Provincial Minister of the Friars Minors’; this must be William of
Gainsborough<a name='fna_1046' id='fna_1046' href='#f_1046'><small>[1046]</small></a>. Robert Cross was buried at Bridgwater<a name='fna_1047' id='fna_1047' href='#f_1047'><small>[1047]</small></a>. None of
his works remain. Leland mentions his commentaries on the <i>Physics</i> and
the <i>Sentences</i>, on the authority of the Catalogue of Illustrious
Franciscans.</p>

<p>16. <b>Roger de Marston</b> or <b>Merscheton</b><a name='fna_1048' id='fna_1048' href='#f_1048'><small>[1048]</small></a> was D.D. of Oxford and lecturer
to the Franciscans before 1290. Some questions on which he disputed,
perhaps before he became doctor, are preserved in a MS. at Assisi<a name='fna_1049' id='fna_1049' href='#f_1049'><small>[1049]</small></a>.
He subsequently lectured at Cambridge as twelfth master of the
friars<a name='fna_1050' id='fna_1050' href='#f_1050'><small>[1050]</small></a>. According to Ehrle, Marston’s theological and philosophical
teaching bears strong resemblance in some respects to that of Peter John
Olivi<a name='fna_1051' id='fna_1051' href='#f_1051'><small>[1051]</small></a>. He became thirteenth Provincial Minister perhaps at the great
Chapter of Paris in 1292,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> certainly between 1285 (when W. of Gainsborough
was appointed) and 1299 (when Hugh of Hertepol was Provincial). He is said
to have been warden of Norwich and to have died in 1303<a name='fna_1052' id='fna_1052' href='#f_1052'><small>[1052]</small></a>. He was

the end of the thirteenth century. Except the <i>quaestiones disputatae</i> at
Assisi, it is doubtful whether any of his works are extant<a name='fna_1057' id='fna_1057' href='#f_1057'><small>[1057]</small></a>. Leland

<p>20. <b>Hugh de Hertepol</b> or <b>Hartlepool</b> was a friar and a man of importance in
Oxford in 1282, when Devorguila appointed him to be one of the two
proctors to whom the government of the new college of Balliol was
entrusted; the statutes of 1282 are addressed to ‘Friar Hugh de Hertilpoll
and Master William de Menyl<a name='fna_1061' id='fna_1061' href='#f_1061'><small>[1061]</small></a>.’ It was probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> some years later that
Hugh became S.T.P. and lecturer to the Franciscan convent. His
disputations seem to have been considered valuable and several of them are
preserved<a name='fna_1062' id='fna_1062' href='#f_1062'><small>[1062]</small></a>. He disputed</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘in the vesperies before the inception of Friar John de Persole (i.e.
Persora, his successor) at Oxford<a name='fna_1063' id='fna_1063' href='#f_1063'><small>[1063]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He became fourteenth Provincial Minister, in succession to Roger Marston.
The date of his appointment or election is uncertain. In April 1299<a name='fna_1064' id='fna_1064' href='#f_1064'><small>[1064]</small></a>,
we hear of him going as Provincial, with Friar W. of Gainsborough as his
<i>socius</i>, to the General Chapter at Lyons; on this occasion the King gave
to the two friars 10 marks. In 1300 (Aug. 7) at Dorchester (Oxon), he
chose twenty-two friars of the Oxford convent and presented them to
Dalderby, Bishop of Lincoln<a name='fna_1065' id='fna_1065' href='#f_1065'><small>[1065]</small></a>, with the request that he would license
them to hear confessions. The bishop asked ‘whether he was presenting them
for all the convents in the diocese of Lincoln,’ and, finding that it was
only for the Oxford convent, refused to license more than four. At length
a compromise was effected, and eight of the friars were licensed to hear
confessions in the archdeaconry of Oxford. In 1301<a name='fna_1066' id='fna_1066' href='#f_1066'><small>[1066]</small></a>, Hugh was again
abroad, probably at the General Chapter at Genoa. In Sept. 1302, he was,
with W. of Gainsborough and others, sent as ambassador to the Court of
Rome to negotiate for peace with the King of France<a name='fna_1067' id='fna_1067' href='#f_1067'><small>[1067]</small></a>. While in Italy
on this mission, he attended the General Chapter at Assisi<a name='fna_1068' id='fna_1068' href='#f_1068'><small>[1068]</small></a>; he
probably did not return to England, as we are told that he was ‘buried

entirely confined to his work as lecturer. Boniface was at this time
endeavouring to bring the war between France and England to a close by
arbitration. In Sept. 1300, Friar William of Gainsborough was appointed by
Edward I to act as one of his ‘proctors and special messengers’ at Rome in
this matter<a name='fna_1085' id='fna_1085' href='#f_1085'><small>[1085]</small></a>; and in Sept. 1302, he was employed with Hugh of

June 9, 1303<a name='fna_1087' id='fna_1087' href='#f_1087'><small>[1087]</small></a>. As a protest against the Papal interference, the King
imposed a fine of 1000 marks on the new bishop<a name='fna_1088' id='fna_1088' href='#f_1088'><small>[1088]</small></a>, but granted him £100

state<a name='fna_1090' id='fna_1090' href='#f_1090'><small>[1090]</small></a>. In March 1307, at Carlisle, he demanded and obtained from the
Papal nuncio the excommunication of the murderers of John Comyn<a name='fna_1091' id='fna_1091' href='#f_1091'><small>[1091]</small></a>. On

France to claim the hand of Isabella<a name='fna_1092' id='fna_1092' href='#f_1092'><small>[1092]</small></a>. Later in the same year he was

return journey<a name='fna_1094' id='fna_1094' href='#f_1094'><small>[1094]</small></a> he died at Beauvais (Sept. 17); as nearly all his
attendants died at the same time, it was believed that the calamity was
due to poison<a name='fna_1095' id='fna_1095' href='#f_1095'><small>[1095]</small></a>. The bishop was buried among the Friars Minors at

regent master of the Franciscans at Oxford in 1300. He was one of the
twenty-two friars presented by Hugh of Hertepol on July 26 of this year,

of the eight actually licensed<a name='fna_1102' id='fna_1102' href='#f_1102'><small>[1102]</small></a>. He afterwards read at Cambridge as
the twenty-ninth master of the Friars Minors<a name='fna_1103' id='fna_1103' href='#f_1103'><small>[1103]</small></a>. An ‘Adam de Houdene’

<p>32. <b>Martin of Alnwick</b> was a member of the Oxford convent in 1300; he was
among the twenty-two friars for whom Hugh of Hertepol sought to obtain
license to hear confessions, and was one of those rejected. He was not a
D.D. at this time<a name='fna_1110' id='fna_1110' href='#f_1110'><small>[1110]</small></a>. He took his degree and lectured at Oxford between
1300 and 1311. In the latter year he was summoned to Avignon to take part
in the controversy between the Conventual and Spiritual Franciscans, as
one of the four advisers of the General Minister. The matter was tried by
a commission of cardinals and theologians; Martin and his fellows pleaded
the cause of the Conventuals, or Community of the Order. The case was
adjourned to the Council of Vienne and decided by the bull <i>Exivi de
Paradiso</i> (which was published in the last session of the Council, May 6,
1313) in favour of the better section of the Conventuals<a name='fna_1111' id='fna_1111' href='#f_1111'><small>[1111]</small></a>. Martin of

master of the Minorites at Cambridge<a name='fna_1114' id='fna_1114' href='#f_1114'><small>[1114]</small></a>. He was sixteenth Provincial of
England, and held the office in 1310<a name='fna_1115' id='fna_1115' href='#f_1115'><small>[1115]</small></a>. About this time the Order was
disturbed by the violent antagonism of the two parties within it&mdash;the
‘Community,’ the lax or moderate party which comprised the majority and
included the official heads of the Order, and the strict or ‘Spiritual’
party. A papal investigation into the causes of dispute and into the
observance of Rule by the Order was instituted, and the leaders of each
party summoned to the Curia. Richard Conyngton as Provincial was the
official representative of the English Franciscans at Avignon and Vienne
(1301-1313)<a name='fna_1116' id='fna_1116' href='#f_1116'><small>[1116]</small></a>. He was buried at Cambridge<a name='fna_1117' id='fna_1117' href='#f_1117'><small>[1117]</small></a>.</p>

<p>63. <b>Thomas Radford</b> (cf. 51st master).</p>

<p>64. <b>John Went</b> or <b>Gwent</b> was a native of the Bristol custody<a name='fna_1193' id='fna_1193' href='#f_1193'><small>[1193]</small></a>. He
probably incepted in theology and lectured to the Friars at Oxford about
1340 or soon after. His character for holiness was such that he was
believed to have wrought miracles in his lifetime<a name='fna_1194' id='fna_1194' href='#f_1194'><small>[1194]</small></a>. He succeeded John
de Rodyngton as Provincial Minister, being the twentieth in Order,
probably between 1340 and 1350<a name='fna_1195' id='fna_1195' href='#f_1195'><small>[1195]</small></a>. Bale adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘he died at Hereford <span class="smcaplc">A. D.</span> 1348, as I have found in a register of the
Minorites<a name='fna_1196' id='fna_1196' href='#f_1196'><small>[1196]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>It is however not improbable that he found only the first statement in the
register and added the date. Both the catalogues of the Provincial
Ministers state that he was buried at Hereford<a name='fna_1197' id='fna_1197' href='#f_1197'><small>[1197]</small></a>.</p>

<p>65. <b>Thomas Oterborne</b> can hardly have written the chronicle generally
ascribed to him. The chronicle itself bears no marks of having been
written by a Franciscan; even the notices of the Order given in Walsingham
and the Eulogium Historiarum are sometimes omitted, and usually shortened,
in the so-called Otterbourne. But apart from this, the evidence of dates
is fairly conclusive: the chronicle, as edited by Hearne, leaves off
abruptly in the year 1420, and Hearne puts Otterbourne’s death at 1421.
Pits and Wood suppose from MSS. which end in 1411 that the writer died in
that year. Hearne says</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘there are not wanting MSS. which bring the history hardly beyond
Edward III.’</p></div>

<p>But even assuming the existence of such MSS. it is practically impossible
that they can have been the work of the Franciscan doctor. Thomas
Oterborne must have lectured at Oxford before 1350. It is true that the
last nine names of lectors given in the list are in a more recent hand
than the earlier ones; but the names of Went and Oterborne are in the same
writing, and there can be no reasonable doubt that they were
contemporaries. The dates of Oterborne’s two immediate successors at
Oxford are unknown<a name='fna_1198' id='fna_1198' href='#f_1198'><small>[1198]</small></a>, and the list of lectors here comes to an end. We
cannot therefore know whether there were any more lectors before Simon
Tunstede. Assuming that he was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> sixty-eighth lector, we may naturally
conclude that the sixty-fifth read several years before him, i.e. several
years before 1351 when Simon was ‘regent among the Minorites at
Oxford<a name='fna_1199' id='fna_1199' href='#f_1199'><small>[1199]</small></a>.’ It is therefore most probable that Thomas was reader not
later than 1345. The historian was perhaps the Thomas Otterburn who became
rector of Chingford in 1393 and was ordained priest in 1394<a name='fna_1200' id='fna_1200' href='#f_1200'><small>[1200]</small></a>.</p>

<p>66. <b>John Valeys</b><a name='fna_1201' id='fna_1201' href='#f_1201'><small>[1201]</small></a> was perhaps the Friar John Wells who took a
prominent part in the disputed election to the Chancellorship in 1349, as
a supporter of John Wyllyot, fellow of Merton, whose conduct seems to have
been of a peculiarly riotous and lawless character<a name='fna_1202' id='fna_1202' href='#f_1202'><small>[1202]</small></a>. He may possibly
be the John Welle, S.T.P. and Friar Minor<a name='fna_1203' id='fna_1203' href='#f_1203'><small>[1203]</small></a>, who was robbed by his
servant in London in 1377; some curious details about this affair will be

<p class="title">FRANCISCANS WHO STUDIED IN THE CONVENT AT OXFORD, OR HAD SOME OTHER CONNEXION WITH THE TOWN OR THE UNIVERSITY.</p>


<p><b>Agnellus</b> or <b>Angnellus of Pisa</b> was custodian of Paris before becoming first
Provincial of England<a name='fna_1204' id='fna_1204' href='#f_1204'><small>[1204]</small></a>. He is said to have been made Provincial by
St. Francis in 1219<a name='fna_1205' id='fna_1205' href='#f_1205'><small>[1205]</small></a>; the order as given by Francis a S. Clara<a name='fna_1206' id='fna_1206' href='#f_1206'><small>[1206]</small></a>
is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Ego frater Franciscus de Assisio Minister Generalis praecipio tibi
fratri Agnello de Pisa per obedientiam, ut vadas ad Angliam, et ibi
facias officium Ministeratus. Vale. Frater Franciscus de Assisio.’</p></div>

<p>It may be doubted whether this letter is authentic, nor is the date beyond
dispute. It may be considered as certain that Agnellus did not come to
England till September 1224<a name='fna_1207' id='fna_1207' href='#f_1207'><small>[1207]</small></a>. He was then a deacon, and about thirty
years of age<a name='fna_1208' id='fna_1208' href='#f_1208'><small>[1208]</small></a>. He landed with eight others at Dover, went to
Canterbury, and thence to London, establishing houses and receiving
novices. Such was his humility that he long refused the order of
priesthood, and only at length consented, when the Provincial Chapter had
procured a command from the General Chapter, that the order should be
conferred on him<a name='fna_1209' id='fna_1209' href='#f_1209'><small>[1209]</small></a>. He was a zealous guardian of the primitive poverty
of the Rule of St. Francis, and would only allow houses to be built or
areas to be enlarged where it was absolutely necessary<a name='fna_1210' id='fna_1210' href='#f_1210'><small>[1210]</small></a>. He urged the
demolition of a conventual building called <i>Valvert</i> at Paris, and forbade
the enlargement of the house at Gloucester: he had the infirmary at Oxford
built so low that a man could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> scarcely stand upright in it. He built a
school at Oxford of more generous proportions, and encouraged the love of
learning in the Order<a name='fna_1211' id='fna_1211' href='#f_1211'><small>[1211]</small></a>. The choice of Grostete as the first master of
the Minorites was due to Agnellus<a name='fna_1212' id='fna_1212' href='#f_1212'><small>[1212]</small></a>. He was, according to Matthew
Paris, on familiar terms with the King, and was one of his
counsellors<a name='fna_1213' id='fna_1213' href='#f_1213'><small>[1213]</small></a>. In December, 1233, he offered his services as
peace-maker between Henry III and the rebellious Earl Marshall, though his
efforts to induce the latter to submit were unavailing<a name='fna_1214' id='fna_1214' href='#f_1214'><small>[1214]</small></a>. It would
seem to have been after this that he went to Rome on some business of the
English prelates<a name='fna_1215' id='fna_1215' href='#f_1215'><small>[1215]</small></a>, and he may also at the same time have attended a
General Chapter in Italy<a name='fna_1216' id='fna_1216' href='#f_1216'><small>[1216]</small></a>. On his return, he was seized with
dysentery at Oxford; it was believed that his health had never recovered
from the severities to which he was exposed while labouring for peace in
the winter of 1233<a name='fna_1217' id='fna_1217' href='#f_1217'><small>[1217]</small></a>. He recommended that the General Minister, Elias,
should be requested to appoint Albert of Pisa, or Haymo, or Radulf of
Rheims, as his successor. He constituted Peter of Tewkesbury his Vicar,
and made his last confession to him. He died at Oxford in great pain,
crying continually, ‘<i>Veni, dulcissime Jesu</i>.’ The exact date of his death
is uncertain; it was probably early in 1235<a name='fna_1218' id='fna_1218' href='#f_1218'><small>[1218]</small></a>. He was, says Eccleston,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘a man specially endowed with natural prudence and foresight, and
conspicuous for every virtue<a name='fna_1219' id='fna_1219' href='#f_1219'><small>[1219]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He was buried in a wooden or leaden coffin in the choir of the chapel
before the altar. When this chapel was superseded by the larger church,
the friars came by night to remove the body; they found the coffin and the
grave</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘full of the purest oil, the corpse with its garments incorrupt and
smelling most sweetly.’</p></div>

<p>His bones were laid with due pomp in ‘a fair stone sepulchre’ in the new
church, and the miracles which were wrought at his tomb were a source of
honour and profit to the Convent at Oxford<a name='fna_1220' id='fna_1220' href='#f_1220'><small>[1220]</small></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span><b>Richard de Ingewrthe</b> or <b>Indewurde</b> (Norfolk) is named second in the list of
friars who came over with Agnellus in 1224. He was a priest and advanced
in years; according to Eccleston he was the first Minorite who preached to
the people ‘<i>citra montes</i>.’ With three other friars he established the
first house of Franciscans in London (at Cornhill); he then proceeded to
Oxford with Richard of Devon, hired a house of Robert le Mercer in St.
Ebbe’s, and thus founded the original convent in the University town. The
two companions then went on to Northampton, where they again hired a house
and founded a friary. Richard of Ingewrthe afterwards became custodian of
Cambridge, which was specially noted for its poverty under his rule. In
1230, when Agnellus attended the General Chapter at Assisi, he was
associated in the Vicariate of the English Province with Henry de Ceruise
or Treviso, a lay-brother from Lombardy. Soon after this he was sent by
the General, John Parens, as Provincial Minister to Ireland. At length he
was released from the office in General Chapter by Albert of Pisa (c.
1239), set out as a missionary to Palestine, and died there<a name='fna_1221' id='fna_1221' href='#f_1221'><small>[1221]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Richard of Devon</b>, a young acolyte, was the third of those who came over
with Agnellus. He accompanied R. of Ingewrthe from Canterbury to London,
Oxford, and Northampton;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘and (in Eccleston’s words) left us many examples of longsuffering and
obedience. For after he had traversed many provinces in obedience to
commands, he was for fifteen years worn out by frequent quartan fevers
and remained continually at Romehale<a name='fna_1222' id='fna_1222' href='#f_1222'><small>[1222]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p><b>Adam of Oxford</b> was a master before he entered the Order<a name='fna_1223' id='fna_1223' href='#f_1223'><small>[1223]</small></a>. The account
of his conversion given by Eccleston<a name='fna_1224' id='fna_1224' href='#f_1224'><small>[1224]</small></a> is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Master Adam of Oxford, of worldwide fame<a name='fna_1225' id='fna_1225' href='#f_1225'><small>[1225]</small></a>, had made a vow that he
would do anything he was asked to do ‘for the love of the blessed
Mary;’ and he told this to a certain recluse, who was a friend of his.
She revealed his secret to her friends, that is, to a monk of Reading,
another of the Cistercian Order, and a Friar Preacher; telling them
that they could gain such a man in such a way; not wishing that Adam
should become a Friar Minor. But the Blessed Virgin did not permit
anyone in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>his presence to make the needful request; but deferred it
to another time. One night he dreamed that he had to cross a bridge,
where some men were throwing their nets into the stream, endeavouring
to catch him: but he escaped this with great difficulty and reached a
very peaceful spot. Now when by the divine will he had escaped all
others, he went casually to see the Friars Minors, and during the
conversation Friar William de Colvile, the elder, a man of great
sanctity, said to him: ‘Dear master, enter our Order for the love of
the Mother of God and help our simplicity.’ And Adam immediately
consented to do so, as if he had heard the words from the lips of the
Mother of God.</p></div>

<p>He assumed the habit on January 25<a name='fna_1226' id='fna_1226' href='#f_1226'><small>[1226]</small></a>, probably <span class="smcaplc">A. D.</span> 1227. He was at
this time assistant, or secretary<a name='fna_1227' id='fna_1227' href='#f_1227'><small>[1227]</small></a>, to the great Adam Marsh, whom he
soon afterwards induced to join the Franciscans. Shortly after this, Adam
of Oxford went to Gregory IX, and was at his own desire sent to preach to
the Saracens<a name='fna_1228' id='fna_1228' href='#f_1228'><small>[1228]</small></a>. From a letter of Grostete’s, addressed to Agnellus and
the Convent of Friars Minors at Oxford, relating to this subject, and
written in or before 1231<a name='fna_1229' id='fna_1229' href='#f_1229'><small>[1229]</small></a>, we learn that Adam had formed the
resolution of going to preach to the infidels before he entered the Order,
and that he was induced to take this latter step partly because it was
likely to add to his influence as a missionary. Grostete urges the Friars
not to grieve for his loss:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘for the light of his knowledge is so bright that it ought to be
concentrated most there where it may dissipate the thickest darkness
of infidelity.’ ‘Have no fear,’ the writer continues, ‘that he will be
cut off from the “Sacred Page;” he has humility, and no “<i>haeretica
pravitas</i>” will slip in.’</p></div>

<p>He died at Barlete, and miracles are said to have been wrought by his
relics or his memory<a name='fna_1230' id='fna_1230' href='#f_1230'><small>[1230]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>William of York</b>, ‘a solemn bachelor,’ was probably an Oxford man, as he
entered the Order on the same day as Adam of Oxford<a name='fna_1231' id='fna_1231' href='#f_1231'><small>[1231]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Adam Rufus</b><a name='fna_1232' id='fna_1232' href='#f_1232'><small>[1232]</small></a> studied under Grostete in the early part of the
thirteenth century, presumably at Oxford. A letter from ‘Robert Grostete
called Master,’ written perhaps before he held any preferments, i.e.
before 1210, addressed to ‘Master Adam Rufus,’ is extant; it is a treatise
on the nature of angels, and Grostete asks Adam to inquire diligently the
opinions of the wise men, with whom he converses, on the subject. In
another letter written about 1237,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> Grostete mentions having heard of
Friar Ernulphus, papal penitentiary, from ‘Friar Adam Rufus of good
memory,’ formerly his beloved pupil and friend. It may be inferred from
his connexion with Grostete and Ernulphus or Arnulfus, Vicar of the Order
of Minorites<a name='fna_1233' id='fna_1233' href='#f_1233'><small>[1233]</small></a>, that the Order which he entered was that of the
Franciscans.</p>

<p><b>Henry de Reresby</b>, who entered the Order abroad, was vicar of the custodian
of Oxford about 1235 or before. He was made first provincial of Scotland
by Elias, but died before he could enter on his duties<a name='fna_1234' id='fna_1234' href='#f_1234'><small>[1234]</small></a>. According to
Leland’s notes from Eccleston he died at Leicester; according to another
account, at Acre in Norfolk<a name='fna_1235' id='fna_1235' href='#f_1235'><small>[1235]</small></a>. After his death he appeared to the
custodian of Oxford, and said that,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘if the friars were not damned for excess in buildings, they would at
any rate be severely punished,’ and added, ‘if the friars said the
divine service well, they would be the sheep of the Apostles<a name='fna_1236' id='fna_1236' href='#f_1236'><small>[1236]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p><b>Walter</b>, a canon of Dunstable, and <b>John</b>, a novice of the same priory,
escaped from their house through a broken window and joined the
Franciscans at Oxford in 1233. Walter afterwards returned with three
Minorites to the Chapter of Dunstable, seeking absolution. After
submitting to corporal punishment, he was absolved; he was further ordered
to restore the books and clothes (<i>quaternos et pannos</i>) which he had
taken with him, and to deliberate for a year&mdash;i.e. during his
noviciate&mdash;whether the discipline of the Order which he had entered was
more severe than that of the Order he had left; if it were so, he was to
remain a Minorite; if not, he was to return to Dunstable. John was found
by the Prior of Dunstable at London and similarly absolved: he afterwards
went to Rome<a name='fna_1237' id='fna_1237' href='#f_1237'><small>[1237]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John of Reading</b>, who became Abbat of Osney in 1229<a name='fna_1238' id='fna_1238' href='#f_1238'><small>[1238]</small></a>, joined the
Minorites in 1235, probably at Northampton<a name='fna_1239' id='fna_1239' href='#f_1239'><small>[1239]</small></a>. He is probably the Abbat
to whom Bartholomew of Pisa refers as having assisted with his own hands
at the building of the Franciscan Church at Oxford<a name='fna_1240' id='fna_1240' href='#f_1240'><small>[1240]</small></a>. He was certainly
at Oxford about 1250, when Adam Marsh wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> to the Provincial that he was
in ill-health and requested that Friar Adam de Bechesoueres, the physician
of the Order, might be sent to Oxford to attend him<a name='fna_1241' id='fna_1241' href='#f_1241'><small>[1241]</small></a>. Another ‘Frater
Johannes Anglicus de Redingis’ was Visitor of Germany in 1229, and
Minister of Saxony 1230-1232<a name='fna_1242' id='fna_1242' href='#f_1242'><small>[1242]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Albert of Pisa</b> did not, as stated by Bartholomew of Pisa and others,
accompany Agnellus to England. He was (according to Eccleston) Minister of
Hungary, Germany (1223-1227), Bologna, the March of Ancona, the March of
Treviso, Tuscany, perhaps of Spain in 1227<a name='fna_1243' id='fna_1243' href='#f_1243'><small>[1243]</small></a>. He was one of the three
recommended by Agnellus as fit persons to succeed him as Provincial of
England, but he was not appointed by Elias till almost a year after the
death of the first Minister<a name='fna_1244' id='fna_1244' href='#f_1244'><small>[1244]</small></a> (c. 1236). He reached England on
December 13, and celebrated a Provincial Chapter at Oxford on February
2<a name='fna_1245' id='fna_1245' href='#f_1245'><small>[1245]</small></a>. On another occasion Eccleston tells us&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Friar Albert was present at the sermon of a young friar at Oxford;
and when the preacher boldly condemned loftiness of buildings and
abundance of food, he rebuked him for vainglory<a name='fna_1246' id='fna_1246' href='#f_1246'><small>[1246]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>Soon after his arrival, Albert appointed lecturers at London and
Canterbury<a name='fna_1247' id='fna_1247' href='#f_1247'><small>[1247]</small></a>, though he does not appear to have been a learned man
himself. His connexion with Oxford was slight, and his acts as Provincial
can hardly claim a place here. After remaining two years and a half in
England, he went to Rome to take part in the proceedings against
Elias<a name='fna_1248' id='fna_1248' href='#f_1248'><small>[1248]</small></a>. On the deposition of the latter (May 15, 1239), Albert was
elected Minister General. He died in the same or the following year<a name='fna_1249' id='fna_1249' href='#f_1249'><small>[1249]</small></a>
and was buried at Rome<a name='fna_1250' id='fna_1250' href='#f_1250'><small>[1250]</small></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span><b>Ralph of Maidstone</b>, bishop of Hereford 1234-1239, resigned his see in
December, 1239, and was admitted into the Franciscan Order by Haymo<a name='fna_1251' id='fna_1251' href='#f_1251'><small>[1251]</small></a>.
He took this step in accordance with a vow, made perhaps before he became
bishop<a name='fna_1252' id='fna_1252' href='#f_1252'><small>[1252]</small></a>. It is uncertain at which convent he took the habit.
Bartholomew of Pisa states that he helped with his own hands to build the
church at Oxford<a name='fna_1253' id='fna_1253' href='#f_1253'><small>[1253]</small></a>. It is not improbable that he was there for some
time. He was a Master of Paris, noted for his learning, and was among the
‘famous Englishmen’ who left Paris owing to the disputes in 1229 and
settled at Oxford on the invitation of Henry III<a name='fna_1254' id='fna_1254' href='#f_1254'><small>[1254]</small></a>. According to a
later addition in one of the MSS. of Eccleston’s Chronicle, he lived five
years after assuming the habit, staying for the most part in the convent
of Gloucester<a name='fna_1255' id='fna_1255' href='#f_1255'><small>[1255]</small></a>. The Dunstable Annals state that he was, for a time at
any rate, rendered incapable by a fall from a rock, but whether this took
place before or after he became a friar is not quite clear<a name='fna_1256' id='fna_1256' href='#f_1256'><small>[1256]</small></a>. He died
at Gloucester (c. 1245) and</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘was buried in the choir of the brethren, in the presbytery, on the
north side under an arch<a name='fna_1257' id='fna_1257' href='#f_1257'><small>[1257]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>A most interesting relic of the friar-bishop is now in the British Museum.
Royal MS. 3 C. xi, a copy of the New Testament with gloss (sec. xiii),
belonged to the Friars Minors of Canterbury,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘<i>ex dono Fratris Radulphi de Maydenestane, quondam Episcopi
Herefordensis</i>.’</p></div>

<p>He wrote a <i>Commentary on the Sentences</i> when he was Archdeacon of Chester
(c. <span class="smcaplc">A. D.</span> 1220). This is mentioned in a treatise on the Sacraments,
‘<i>secundum Mag. R. de Maidinstan archidiaconum Cestrensem super
Sententias</i>.’</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">MS. London: Gray’s Inn, 14, f. 28-32 (sec. xiii).</p></div>

<p><b>William of Nottingham</b> was marked out by nature for a Mendicant Friar.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘He told me,’ writes Eccleston, ‘that when he was living in his
father’s <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>house and some poor boys came begging alms, he gave them of
his bread, and received the crust from them, because it seemed to him,
that hard bread, which was asked for the love of God, was sweeter than
the delicate bread which he ate and his companions; and so, to make
their bread sweet like this, the little boys went and begged in their
turn (<i>ab invicem</i>) for the love of God<a name='fna_1258' id='fna_1258' href='#f_1258'><small>[1258]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>William’s brother, Augustine, was also a Minorite; he was first in the
household of Innocent IV, accompanied the Patriarch of Antioch, the pope’s
nephew, to Syria, and at length became bishop of Laodicea<a name='fna_1259' id='fna_1259' href='#f_1259'><small>[1259]</small></a>. William
himself successfully championed the interests of his Order against the
Dominicans at the Roman Curia<a name='fna_1260' id='fna_1260' href='#f_1260'><small>[1260]</small></a>. At one period he lived for some time
in the Franciscan convent at Rome, where, though (to quote his own words)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the brethren had no pittance except chestnuts, he grew so fat that he
often blushed<a name='fna_1261' id='fna_1261' href='#f_1261'><small>[1261]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He acted as vicar for Friar Haymo in England (1239), and in 1240 was
himself</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘elected and confirmed Provincial Minister by those to whom the
appointment had been entrusted<a name='fna_1262' id='fna_1262' href='#f_1262'><small>[1262]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He had never held any subordinate office, such as that of custodian or
warden<a name='fna_1263' id='fna_1263' href='#f_1263'><small>[1263]</small></a>. He was a diligent student of the Scriptures, and seems to
have attended Grostete’s lectures at Oxford<a name='fna_1264' id='fna_1264' href='#f_1264'><small>[1264]</small></a>. As minister, he was
energetic in furthering the study of theology, and in developing the
educational organization of the Franciscans in England<a name='fna_1265' id='fna_1265' href='#f_1265'><small>[1265]</small></a>. During his
ministry, the friary at Oxford was greatly enlarged<a name='fna_1266' id='fna_1266' href='#f_1266'><small>[1266]</small></a>. Evidence of his
popularity was given in the Chapter held at Oxford by the General
Minister, John of Parma (c. 1248), when the friars unanimously refused to
sanction his deposition<a name='fna_1267' id='fna_1267' href='#f_1267'><small>[1267]</small></a>. He was ‘absolved’ from the ministry in the
General Chapter of Metz, and sent on behalf of the Order to the
Pope<a name='fna_1268' id='fna_1268' href='#f_1268'><small>[1268]</small></a>. It was probably in this Chapter, that, with the assistance of
John Kethene and Gregory de Bosellis, he carried a decree ‘almost against
the whole Chapter,’</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘ut privilegium indultum a Domino Papa de recipienda pecunia per
procuratores penitus destrueretur; et expositio Regulae secundum
dominum <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>Innocentium, quantum ad ea in quibus laxior esset quam
Gregoriana, suspenderetur<a name='fna_1269' id='fna_1269' href='#f_1269'><small>[1269]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The cause of his deposition is unknown, but the event excited the
displeasure of the English friars, who called a Provincial Chapter and
unanimously re-elected him<a name='fna_1270' id='fna_1270' href='#f_1270'><small>[1270]</small></a>. A letter from Adam Marsh, congratulating
him on this second election and urging him not to decline the office is
extant<a name='fna_1271' id='fna_1271' href='#f_1271'><small>[1271]</small></a>. But William of Nottingham was already dead. When he reached
Genoa on his mission to the Pope, his <i>socius</i>, Friar Richard, was struck
down by the plague;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘while others fled, he remained to comfort his companion, and like him
he was struck down and died<a name='fna_1272' id='fna_1272' href='#f_1272'><small>[1272]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The date of the Chapter of Metz, and consequently of William’s death, is
not quite certain; it was probably in the spring or early summer of
1251<a name='fna_1273' id='fna_1273' href='#f_1273'><small>[1273]</small></a>. A few extracts from the chronicle of Eccleston (who knew him
personally) will illustrate the character of the man.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He sat very long in meditation after matins, and was unwilling to
attend to confessions and consultations at night, as his predecessors
had done.... Above all things, he was careful to avoid the vice of
suspicion. Familiarities of great persons and of women he most
studiously avoided, and, with wonderful magnanimity, thought nothing
of incurring the anger of the powerful for the sake of justice. He
used to say that great persons entrap those familiar with them by
their advice, and women with their mendacity and malice turn the heads
even of the devout by their flatteries. He studied with all diligence
to restore the good name of those who were defamed, provided that he
thought them penitent, and to comfort the hearts of the desolate,

regard to money than had hitherto obtained in England, holding that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the friars might in a hundred cases lawfully contract debts, and

open, and they found only a piece of parchment with the words; Brother

<p><b>A. of Hereford</b> (c. 1248) was assigned by the Provincial to Adam Marsh as
his secretary. Adam thought him too able a man to be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> in this
subordinate position; his learning and eloquence marked him out for a
teacher and preacher; many of those appointed by the Provincial Chapter to
lecture on theology were far inferior to him. In addition to this his
health would not stand the constant strain to which the secretary of the
indefatigable doctor was necessarily subjected. Adam therefore requested
the Provincial to send him to London to pursue his studies, as A. of
Hereford himself desired<a name='fna_1279' id='fna_1279' href='#f_1279'><small>[1279]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Laurence de Sutthon</b> was the friar whom Adam Marsh suggested to the
Provincial as A. of Hereford’s successor. A ‘Friar Laurence’ was with Adam
in 1249, and the latter wrote to Thomas of York, probably after 1250:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Friar Laurence sends you the books of the mother of philosophy (?)
for which you sent<a name='fna_1280' id='fna_1280' href='#f_1280'><small>[1280]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p><b>Hugo de Lyndun</b> seems to have been a weak brother at Oxford&mdash;weak in mind
and body&mdash;whom Adam Marsh took under his especial care (c. 1253)<a name='fna_1281' id='fna_1281' href='#f_1281'><small>[1281]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John of Beverley</b> was a friar at Oxford when Martin was warden, and was
known to Adam Marsh. Friar Thomas of York laboured for the salvation of
the father of this J. of Beverley<a name='fna_1282' id='fna_1282' href='#f_1282'><small>[1282]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Gregory de Bosellis</b> was the first lecturer to the friars at
Leicester<a name='fna_1283' id='fna_1283' href='#f_1283'><small>[1283]</small></a> (c. 1240?). He was at the General Chapter of Genoa (1244)
or Metz when he supported W. of Nottingham, Minister of England<a name='fna_1284' id='fna_1284' href='#f_1284'><small>[1284]</small></a>; and
he was Vicar of the Province at the time of the same Minister’s
death<a name='fna_1285' id='fna_1285' href='#f_1285'><small>[1285]</small></a>. He was with the Earl and Countess of Leicester in
Gascony<a name='fna_1286' id='fna_1286' href='#f_1286'><small>[1286]</small></a>, and went to the papal court with the Archbishop of
Canterbury in 1250<a name='fna_1287' id='fna_1287' href='#f_1287'><small>[1287]</small></a>, when the rules of the Order against riding on
horseback were relaxed in his favour<a name='fna_1288' id='fna_1288' href='#f_1288'><small>[1288]</small></a>. He had studied at some
University, probably at Oxford, and was capable of filling Adam Marsh’s
place as lecturer to the friars there, though it does not appear whether
he ever actually did so<a name='fna_1289' id='fna_1289' href='#f_1289'><small>[1289]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Thomas of Maydenstan</b>, an invalid novice at Oxford, c. 1253;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> Adam Marsh
hearing a rumour that he was to be sent away from Oxford begged the
Minister to let him remain,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘as it is believed that his removal would do injury to the souls of
several persons of whose conversion no slight hope is entertained.’</p></div>

<p>The brethren at Oxford joined in the request<a name='fna_1290' id='fna_1290' href='#f_1290'><small>[1290]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Thomas Bachun</b> of the Convent of Nottingham was recommended by Adam Marsh
as a suitable person to act as private secretary or amanuensis to Friar
Richard of Cornwall, when the latter was about to proceed to Paris, 1252.
It is however uncertain whether he was appointed or whether he studied at
Oxford<a name='fna_1291' id='fna_1291' href='#f_1291'><small>[1291]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Adam de Bechesoueres</b> or <b>Hekeshovre</b><a name='fna_1292' id='fna_1292' href='#f_1292'><small>[1292]</small></a> occurs several times in Adam
Marsh’s letters as the chief physician among the early English friars.
Thus at one time Adam writes to John of Stamford, custodian of Oxford,
requesting him to allow a poor sick scholar named Ralph of Multon, a
friend of the writer’s, to consult Friar A. de Bechesoueres, who has
already done him good. The famous Walter de Merton went to him once with a
letter of introduction from Adam Marsh. He was wanted again at Oxford to
attend Friar John of Reading, formerly Abbat of Osney. Adam Marsh
recommended Grostete to consult him about his health. At another time we
hear of him going to the General Minister in France, with a ‘supplicatory
letter’ from Adam Marsh;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘he promised,’ adds the latter in a letter to the English Provincial,
‘to return to England soon and humbly submit in all things to the
regular discipline.’</p></div>

<p><b>N. of Anivers</b>, <b>Anilyeres</b> or <b>Aynelers</b>, a youth of ability, fair learning
and great promise, was ordered by the Minister General to go to France,
probably about the year 1248. Adam Marsh, anxious that the best should be
done both for the young friar and the Order, after consultation with Peter
of Tewkesbury, custodian of Oxford, obtained leave from the Provincials of
England and France for him to stay for a year or two in England, the
consent of the General being also secured:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘it is thought,’ adds Adam in his letter to the Minister of France,
‘that he will at present find the requisite helps to the successful
study of letters more easily obtainable in England than anywhere
else.’</p></div>

<p>N. de Anivers was therefore allowed to spend a year in theological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> study
at Oxford, Cambridge or London. Adam Marsh maintained his interest in his
welfare, and, after the year was over, requested the Minister of France to
allow him to continue his studies in England up to the ensuing Pentecost:
it is probable that he was a pupil of Adam’s at Oxford<a name='fna_1293' id='fna_1293' href='#f_1293'><small>[1293]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>William of Pokelington</b> (Yorkshire) entered the Order about 1250 and made
his profession at Oxford in 1251<a name='fna_1294' id='fna_1294' href='#f_1294'><small>[1294]</small></a>. He was then a master. Shortly
before this he had been ill and perhaps took the vows on his
recovery<a name='fna_1295' id='fna_1295' href='#f_1295'><small>[1295]</small></a>. He was an intimate friend of Adam Marsh and at one period
acted as his secretary<a name='fna_1296' id='fna_1296' href='#f_1296'><small>[1296]</small></a>. Adam employed him several times as messenger
to Grostete<a name='fna_1297' id='fna_1297' href='#f_1297'><small>[1297]</small></a>, who had a high opinion of him and liked to have him as
a companion<a name='fna_1298' id='fna_1298' href='#f_1298'><small>[1298]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Walter de Madele</b>, <b>Maddele</b> or <b>Maddeley</b> studied in the Franciscan Convent at
Oxford (c. 1235 seq.). While here, he ventured to disregard the custom
which forbade the friars to wear shoes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘It happened,’ says Eccleston<a name='fna_1299' id='fna_1299' href='#f_1299'><small>[1299]</small></a>, ‘that he found two shoes, and
when he went to Matins, he put them on. He stood therefore at Matins,
feeling unusually self-satisfied. But afterwards when he was in bed,
he dreamt that he had to go through a dangerous pass between Oxford
and Gloucester called “<i>boysaliz</i>” (?), which was infested by robbers;
and when he was descending into a deep valley, they rushed at him from
both sides, shouting, “Kill him!” In great terror he said that he was
a Friar Minor. “You lie,” they cried, “for you do not go barefoot;”
and when he put out his foot confidently, he found that he was wearing
those same shoes: and starting in confusion from sleep, he threw the
shoes into the middle of the courtyard.’</p></div>

<p>Walter was ‘<i>socius</i>’ or secretary to Agnellus and was at Oxford at the
time of the latter’s death (1235)<a name='fna_1300' id='fna_1300' href='#f_1300'><small>[1300]</small></a>. Later he was in Germany with
Peter of Tewkesbury, minister of Cologne, and returned to England in 1249
with Friar Paulinus, perhaps a German, in obedience to Peter<a name='fna_1301' id='fna_1301' href='#f_1301'><small>[1301]</small></a>. He
enjoyed a considerable reputation as a theologian and was lecturer at a
Franciscan Convent. Adam Marsh once sent for him to come and see him at
Oxford.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘I conferred with him as you desired,’ he writes to the
Provincial<a name='fna_1302' id='fna_1302' href='#f_1302'><small>[1302]</small></a>, ‘about investigating the meaning of Holy Scripture
in the original books of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>the saints, and he professed himself very
ready to do this or anything else which you thought fit to enjoin on
him.’</p></div>

<p>This was not the only subject discussed at the interview. The English
Minister suspected Walter of a desire to go abroad and of having obtained
from the General the promise of a lectureship in some foreign convent or
University. The Provincial had indeed just received an order from the
General to send some English friars to teach at Paris, and perhaps
Madele’s name was mentioned. Madele however denied the imputation, and
Adam recommended the Provincial to keep him in England, sending other
friars to Paris, and to remedy his grievances. Though he had long taught
theology with success, no competent provision had been made for him; he
had not only to exhaust his mind by studies but also to wear out his body
by writing daily with his own hand, as he lacked the ‘great volumes and
the assistance of companions,’ which had been provided for his
predecessors in the office. Eccleston refers to him as dead when he wrote
his chronicle<a name='fna_1303' id='fna_1303' href='#f_1303'><small>[1303]</small></a>. None of Madele’s writings<a name='fna_1304' id='fna_1304' href='#f_1304'><small>[1304]</small></a> have been preserved.</p>

<p><b>G. of St. Edmund</b>: Adam Marsh wrote to the Provincial (W. of Nottingham) on
behalf of Martin the warden and the other friars at Oxford, requesting him
to order without delay</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘that Friar G. de Sancto Eadmundo be restored to the convent of friars
at Oxford<a name='fna_1305' id='fna_1305' href='#f_1305'><small>[1305]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p><b>Thomas of Eccleston</b>, the earliest historian of the Franciscan Order in
England, was probably a native of Lancashire<a name='fna_1306' id='fna_1306' href='#f_1306'><small>[1306]</small></a>. All that is known of
him is contained in his Chronicle. He was an inmate of the London Convent
when William of Nottingham was minister (1240-1250), and speaks from his
own experience of the poverty and hard fare of the brethren there<a name='fna_1307' id='fna_1307' href='#f_1307'><small>[1307]</small></a>.
He was a student at Oxford in the lifetime of Grostete, whether before or
after the latter became bishop is not clear<a name='fna_1308' id='fna_1308' href='#f_1308'><small>[1308]</small></a>. He knew the earliest
converts to the Order in England, and enjoyed the intimacy of William of
Nottingham<a name='fna_1309' id='fna_1309' href='#f_1309'><small>[1309]</small></a>. His history is dedicated to Friar Simon of
Esseby&mdash;perhaps Ashby in Norfolk or Lincolnshire<a name='fna_1310' id='fna_1310' href='#f_1310'><small>[1310]</small></a>. In the preface he
states that he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> collecting and arranging materials for
twenty-five years, and explains his object in writing.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Every upright man ought to judge his life by the examples of better
men, because examples strike home more directly than the words of
reason.’</p></div>

<p>Other Orders have lives of their holy brethren; this Chronicle is intended
similarly to edify the Franciscans by giving them some account of those
who have sacrificed their all to enter the Order and observe the Rule of
St. Francis<a name='fna_1311' id='fna_1311' href='#f_1311'><small>[1311]</small></a>. From this point of view, chronology was of little
importance, and there is scarcely a date in the whole book. It is
impossible to give the exact date at which the Chronicle was finished; the
deaths of William of Nottingham and of Innocent IV are mentioned<a name='fna_1312' id='fna_1312' href='#f_1312'><small>[1312]</small></a>;
and the work was probably not completed before 1260. It is certainly the
narrative of a contemporary, often of an eye-witness, and, apart from the
manifest sincerity of the author, the accuracy of the details can in some
instances be tested by independent and trustworthy authority. To take one
example; Eccleston’s account of the reception of the friars at Cambridge
(pp. 17, 18) may be compared with the following entry in Close Roll 22
Hen. III, m. 12, (June 15 1238):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rex ballivis suis de Cantebr’ salutem. Sciatis quod concessimus
fratribus Minoribus de Cantebr’ domum illam cum pertinenciis in
Cantebr’ que fuit Magistri Benjamin Judei et quam prius vobis
concesseramus ad Gayolam nostram (<i>or</i> vestram) inde faciendam, ad
clausum domorum predictorum fratrum dilatandum, salvis domino feodi
serviciis et redditibus ei inde debitis. Et idem vobis precipimus quod
eisdem fratribus de domo predicta plenam saisinam habere faciatis.</p></div>

<p>The following MSS. of the Chronicle ‘<i>De adventu Fratrum Minorum in
Angliam</i>’ are extant, all dating from the early fourteenth century.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">(1) A mutilated MS. in the Chapter Library at York; Brewer’s text for
the earlier portion of the Chronicle is founded on this.</p>

<p class="hang">(2) Brit. Mus.: Cotton Nero A ix was used by Brewer as the guide for
the later part: this MS. begins with <i>Collatio IX</i> (i.e. <i>Collatio
VIII</i> in the York MS.).</p>

<p class="hang">(3) A fragment of the earlier portion of the Chronicle is contained in
a MS. at Lamport House; this has been printed by Howlett in Mon.
Franc. II; it supplies most of the chapters wanting in the Cottonian
MS., of which it probably formed a part.</p>

<p class="hang">(4) No. 3119 of the MSS. of Sir T. Phillipps (Thirlestaine House,
Cheltenham), contains the whole Chronicle, though without many of the
incidents which occur in the York and Cotton MSS. Neither Brewer nor
Howlett knew of its existence. A short account of it will be found in
‘The English Historical Review,’ Oct. 1890, p. 754.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang">In the same volume of MSS. is the treatise <i>De impugnatione</i>, etc.,
printed in the Appendix C: Bale and Pits ascribe this to Eccleston,
but without sufficient authority.</p></div>

<p><b>Roger Bacon</b> is said on the authority of John Rous<a name='fna_1313' id='fna_1313' href='#f_1313'><small>[1313]</small></a> to have been born
at or near Ilchester in Dorsetshire. He came of a wealthy perhaps noble
family; he speaks of one brother as rich, of another as a scholar. He was
probably nephew of Robert Bacon the Dominican. Roger’s family espoused the
royal cause in the Barons’ war and suffered great losses<a name='fna_1314' id='fna_1314' href='#f_1314'><small>[1314]</small></a>. The year
1214 is usually given as the date of his birth. The date is an inference
from the following passage written in 1267:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘I have laboured much at sciences and languages, and it is now forty
years since I first learnt the alphabet; and I was always studious;
and except for two of those forty years I have always been <i>in
studio</i><a name='fna_1315' id='fna_1315' href='#f_1315'><small>[1315]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>The last phrase probably means ‘at a University’ or some place of study.
Boys of ten or twelve years frequently began their education at Oxford,
and it is likely that Bacon went there at an early age<a name='fna_1316' id='fna_1316' href='#f_1316'><small>[1316]</small></a>. Roger of
Wendover relates that Friar Robert Bacon preached before the King at
Oxford in 1233, and fearlessly rebuked him for listening to evil
counsellors, especially Peter des Roches. Matthew Paris gives the story
with the following addition:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘a clerk of the court of a pleasant wit, namely, Roger Bacun, ventured
to make this joke: “My lord King, what is most harmful to men crossing
a strait, or what makes them most afraid?” The King replied, “Those
men know who occupy their business in great waters.” “I will tell
you,” said the clerk, “<i>Petrae et Rupes</i><a name='fna_1317' id='fna_1317' href='#f_1317'><small>[1317]</small></a>.”’</p></div>

<p>It cannot be regarded as certain that this Roger Bacon was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> famous
friar. The name was not uncommon; e.g. a Roger Bacon, a Thomas Bacon, and
a Peter Bacon occur in Pat. Roll 3 Edw I. On the other hand Roger was
certainly in Oxford in or before this year. He states that St. Edmund,
Archbishop of Canterbury, lectured at Oxford in his time, i.e. Edmund
Riche who became Archbishop in 1233<a name='fna_1318' id='fna_1318' href='#f_1318'><small>[1318]</small></a>. At this period too, Roger
attended Grostete’s lectures and made the acquaintance of Adam Marsh, for
both of whom he always retained the greatest admiration. He found in them
that sympathy with and understanding of his experimental method, which
were denied him in later life<a name='fna_1319' id='fna_1319' href='#f_1319'><small>[1319]</small></a>. It was doubtless his connexion with
these men that led Roger to enter the Franciscan Order. When or where this
took place is unknown: perhaps at Oxford before the death of Grostete. He
had clearly reached years of discretion when he took the step. This may be
inferred from his denunciation of those who entered the Orders as boys and
begun the study of theology before they had been grounded in
philosophy<a name='fna_1320' id='fna_1320' href='#f_1320'><small>[1320]</small></a>. It is also implied in such passages as these:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘When I was in another state, I wrote nothing on philosophy.’ ‘Men
used to wonder before I became a friar that I lived owing to such
excessive labour<a name='fna_1321' id='fna_1321' href='#f_1321'><small>[1321]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He began his studies on positive science before 1250<a name='fna_1322' id='fna_1322' href='#f_1322'><small>[1322]</small></a>, and had by
1267 spent more than 2,000 <i>librae</i><a name='fna_1323' id='fna_1323' href='#f_1323'><small>[1323]</small></a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘on secret books and various experiments and languages and instruments
and tables.’</p></div>

<p>It is not necessary to assume that this sum was expended before he joined
the Franciscan Order; he could, and undoubtedly did, obtain money by
begging to carry on his experiments<a name='fna_1324' id='fna_1324' href='#f_1324'><small>[1324]</small></a>. Roger left Oxford for Paris
some time before 1245; he states that he had seen Alexander of Hales with
his own eyes<a name='fna_1325' id='fna_1325' href='#f_1325'><small>[1325]</small></a>, and he heard William of
Auvergne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> dispute on the
<i>Intellectus Agens</i> before the whole University: William died in
1248<a name='fna_1326' id='fna_1326' href='#f_1326'><small>[1326]</small></a>. Roger was in France in 1250 when he saw the chief of the
Pastoureaux, and remarked that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘he carried in his hand something as though it were sacred, as a man
carries relics<a name='fna_1327' id='fna_1327' href='#f_1327'><small>[1327]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He is said by Rous to have been made D.D. of Paris and to have been
incorporated as D.D. at Oxford<a name='fna_1328' id='fna_1328' href='#f_1328'><small>[1328]</small></a>. When he returned to Oxford is
unknown; probably soon after 1250. He must have lectured at this time; he
won some fame, as he says himself<a name='fna_1329' id='fna_1329' href='#f_1329'><small>[1329]</small></a>, but without doubt made many
enemies. About the year 1257 or 1258&mdash;when Adam Marsh could no longer
protect his great pupil&mdash;Roger was exiled from England and kept under
strict supervision in Paris for ten years<a name='fna_1330' id='fna_1330' href='#f_1330'><small>[1330]</small></a>. In 1263 he wrote an
astronomical treatise called <i>Computus Naturalium</i><a name='fna_1331' id='fna_1331' href='#f_1331'><small>[1331]</small></a>. Soon after this,
a clerk named Raymund of Laon mentioned Bacon’s name to the Cardinal
Bishop of Sabina and roused the latter’s interest in his
discoveries<a name='fna_1332' id='fna_1332' href='#f_1332'><small>[1332]</small></a>. Bacon sent a letter in reply to the Cardinal’s
communication: this has not been preserved. In 1265 the Cardinal became
Pope Clement IV. On 22nd of June 1266, Clement wrote requesting Roger to
send him a fair copy of the work which Raymond had mentioned, setting
forth the remedies he proposed, ‘<i>circa illa, quae nuper occasione tanti
discriminis intimasti</i>;’ the friar was to do this, in spite of any
constitution of his Order to the contrary, secretly and without
delay<a name='fna_1333' id='fna_1333' href='#f_1333'><small>[1333]</small></a>. The Pope’s supposition that the work was already written was
erroneous;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘for,’ writes Roger<a name='fna_1334' id='fna_1334' href='#f_1334'><small>[1334]</small></a>, ‘whilst I was in a different state of life,
I had written nothing on science; nor in my present condition had I
ever been required to do so by my superiors; nay, a strict prohibition
has been passed to the contrary, under penalty of forfeiture of the
book, and many <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>days’ fasting on bread and water, if any book written
by us (i.e. the Franciscans) should be communicated to
strangers<a name='fna_1335' id='fna_1335' href='#f_1335'><small>[1335]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>However, although the book was not yet written, and notwithstanding
endless difficulties, want of money, want of mathematical and other
instruments and tables, the restrictions of the Rule, jealousy of his
superiors and brethren who, he says,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘kept me on bread and water, suffering no one to have access to me,
fearful lest my writings should be divulged to any other than the Pope
and themselves<a name='fna_1336' id='fna_1336' href='#f_1336'><small>[1336]</small></a>’&mdash;</p></div>

<p>the Opus Majus, the Opus Minus, and the Opus Tertium, were sent to the
Pope within fifteen or eighteen months after the arrival of the papal
mandate<a name='fna_1337' id='fna_1337' href='#f_1337'><small>[1337]</small></a>. ‘Such a feat’ says Brewer, ‘is unparalleled in the annals
of literature.’ The Pope probably used his influence in behalf of Roger,
as the latter seems to have returned to England about this time and to
have been freed from annoyance<a name='fna_1338' id='fna_1338' href='#f_1338'><small>[1338]</small></a>. The works sent to Clement he
regarded merely as handbooks; at the same time that he was writing them,
he was engaged on a larger work which was to embrace the whole range of
sciences as then understood<a name='fna_1339' id='fna_1339' href='#f_1339'><small>[1339]</small></a>.
He was working at this in 1271<a name='fna_1340' id='fna_1340' href='#f_1340'><small>[1340]</small></a>.
His attacks on all classes, including his own Order, became even more
violent than hitherto. In 1277 and 1278 synods were held at Paris and
Oxford to condemn erroneous doctrines. The repressive movement extended to
the Franciscans; in 1278, Jerome of Ascoli, the Minister General, held a
Chapter at Paris, and among other friars Roger Bacon was condemned
‘<i>propter quasdam novitates</i><a name='fna_1341' id='fna_1341' href='#f_1341'><small>[1341]</small></a>.’ He is believed to have remained in
prison for fourteen years. Jerome of Ascoli, who became Pope Nicholas IV
in 1288, died in 1292. Raymond Gaufredi, a man of liberal views, was
elected General in 1289, and released many friars who had been imprisoned
for their opinions by his predecessors. In 1292 he held a General Chapter
at Paris, and it is probable that among the friars here set free was Roger
Bacon<a name='fna_1342' id='fna_1342' href='#f_1342'><small>[1342]</small></a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> It
is certain that the last work of Roger’s of which we have
any notice was written in 1292<a name='fna_1343' id='fna_1343' href='#f_1343'><small>[1343]</small></a>. The date usually assigned for his
death (1294) is a pure conjecture<a name='fna_1344' id='fna_1344' href='#f_1344'><small>[1344]</small></a>. John Rous says that he was buried
among the Friars Minors at Oxford<a name='fna_1345' id='fna_1345' href='#f_1345'><small>[1345]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Such then is the chronological outline of his life, as far as it can be
ascertained. A list of his works will be more useful than a short account
of his character or philosophy.</p>

<p><b>Roger Bacon’s Works</b> were neglected and regarded with a pious horror in the
Middle Ages<a name='fna_1346' id='fna_1346' href='#f_1346'><small>[1346]</small></a>. The result is that many of those which have survived at
all have reached us in a fragmentary state. ‘It is easier,’ said Leland,
‘to collect the leaves of the Sibyl than the titles of the works written
by Roger Bacon.’ The difficulty has to a considerable extent been removed
by Mr. Brewer’s valuable preface to the <i>Opera Inedita</i>, and by the
labours of M. Charles. The following account of Roger Bacon’s works is
based chiefly on these two writers. Some additions have been made and some
rearrangement attempted.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Opus Minus</i>, written in 1266-7, was mainly an abstract of the <i>Opus
Majus</i> with some additions on the state of scholasticism, on alchemy
practical and speculative, and on astronomy. Charles gives the following
description of it. It consisted of 6 parts:</p>

<p>i. Introduction or dedicatory letter; ii. Practical alchemy; iii.
Explanation of the <i>Opus Majus</i>; the order of the sciences inverted, i.e.
they were arranged according to their dignity, moral philosophy first; iv.
Treatise on the seven sins of Theology; v. Speculative alchemy, or, <i>De
rerum generationibus</i> (see below); vi. <i>De Coelestibus</i>.</p>

<p>Of this work only the fragment edited by Brewer (<i>Opera Ined.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> 311-390)
from MS. Bodl. Digby 218, has been discovered. This includes a few pages
of Part ii., all of iii., most of iv., and part of v. Wood quotes a
passage from the <i>Opus Minus</i> which does not occur in this fragment
(<i>Opera Ined.</i> xciv. n. 1). From this it has been assumed that he had
access to a MS. of the <i>Opus Minus</i> now lost; but the passage is quoted by
Leland, and probably copied from him by Wood. It may perhaps occur in some
other work of Bacon’s; thus the passage quoted in <i>Op. Ined.</i> pp.
xcvii-xcviii, from which Brewer argues that ‘Wood must have seen some
other copy of the <i>Opus Minus</i> not now discoverable,’ occurs in Brewer’s
edition of the <i>Opus Tert.</i> pp. 272-3.</p>

<p>Part of the blank on p. 375 is to be filled up from the <i>Opus Majus, Pars
VI, Exemplum II</i>, where the passage ‘<i>Est autem&mdash;curabit et</i>’ occurs, word
for word. How much of the <i>Opus Majus</i> was here inserted is doubtful;
probably to the end of <i>Exemplum II</i>. Thus MS. Bodl. Canonic. Miscell.
334, f. 53, begins with the words, ‘<i>Corpora vero Adae et Evae</i>,’ <i>Opus
Minus</i>, p. 373, and leaves off with the words, ‘<i>et alibi multis modis</i>,’
which occur at the end of <i>Opus Majus, Pars VI, Exemp. II</i>.</p>

<p>The last part of the <i>Opus Minus</i> is wholly wanting in Brewer’s edition.
The subject of this part may be gathered from Bacon’s words in <i>Opus
Tert.</i>, cap. xxvi (p. 96):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Nunc igitur tangam aliquas radices circa haec quas diligentius
exposui in Secundo Opere, ubi de coelestibus egi’: and (p. 99) ‘Sed in
Opere Minore ubi de coelestibus tractavi, exposui magis ista.’</p></div>

<p>In Digby MS. 76, fol. 36 seq. (sec. xiii) is a treatise on this subject,
forming part of the <i>Physics</i> in the great <i>Compendium Philosophiae</i> (see
below). It is not improbable, that, before being incorporated in this
larger work, it formed part of the <i>Opus Minus</i> sent to the Pope; on fol.
42 are the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘et est nunc temporis scilicet anno domini 1266.’</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>Charles has been misled by a passage in the work called ‘<i>Communia
Naturalium</i>’ into thinking that this latter formed part of the <i>Opus
Tertium</i>; Charles, <i>R. Bacon</i>, pp. 65, 83-4; his description of <i>Opus
Tertium</i> is consequently erroneous. The passage is from the Mazarine MS.
of the <i>Communia Naturalium</i> (i.e. No. 3576), fol. 85:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Quod est improbatum in secunda parte primi operis, deinde in hoc
tertio opere explanavi hoc et solvi objectiones.’</p></div>

<p>These words refer to Bacon’s doctrine that the <i>intellectus agens</i> is not
part of the soul, but God and angels. This is insisted on in the <i>Opus
Tertium</i>, cap. xxiii, and it is not likely that Bacon would do more than
refer to it again casually in the course of the same work. The relation of
the <i>Opus Tertium</i> to the <i>Commun. Nat.</i> is probably as follows: the
latter was written or begun first. Bacon repeatedly mentions that he was,
while writing his three <i>Opera</i> for the Pope, engaged on a larger work,
<i>Scriptum Principale</i>, which he did not send to Clement<a name='fna_1349' id='fna_1349' href='#f_1349'><small>[1349]</small></a>. Much of
this larger work naturally found its way, probably in a summarised form,
into the <i>Opus Tertium</i> as we know it, the treatise actually sent to the
Pope.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Tractatus de multiplicatione specierum</i>, or, <i>De generatione specierum et
multiplicatione et corruptione earum</i>, is inserted by Jebb in the <i>Opus
Majus</i>, pp. 358-445, between Part v and Part vi. The subject is however
discussed in Part iv, which is often quoted or referred to in Part v. In
the <i>De multiplicatione</i>, &amp;c. (p. 368), are the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ut tactum est in communibus naturalium.</p></div>

<p>Again (p. 358):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Recolendum est igitur quod in tertia parte hujus operis tactum est,
quod essentia, substantia, natura, potestas, potentia, virtus, vis,
significant eandem rem, sed differunt sola comparatione.</p></div>

<p>There is nothing about this in the third part of the <i>Opus Majus</i>; but it
is found in the <i>Communia Naturalium</i>. The treatise <i>De multiplicatione
specierum</i> was therefore part of a work of which the <i>Communia Naturalium</i>
formed the third part. This large work was according to Jebb, the <i>Opus
Minus</i>; according to Charles, the <i>Opus Tertium</i><a name='fna_1350' id='fna_1350' href='#f_1350'><small>[1350]</small></a>; according to
Brewer, the encyclopaedic <i>Compendium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> Philosophiae.</i> Brewer is no doubt
right; the <i>De multiplicatione</i> was intended as a sub-section of the great
treatise on Physics.</p>

<p>How then did the treatise come to be regarded as part of the <i>Opus Majus</i>,
and to be inserted in the MSS. of that work? There can be little doubt
that it was, in its original form, the treatise on rays sent to the Pope
with the <i>Opus Majus</i>, but as a separate work (<i>Opera Ined.</i> pp. 227,
230). The references to the <i>Communia Naturalium</i> are not inconsistent
with this hypothesis: (1) the treatise on rays does not seem to have been
written specially for the Pope, and consequently references to works which
he could not know were not unnatural; (2) Bacon had already begun the
encyclopaedic work, but found it impossible to get it finished or send it
to the Pope (<i>Opera Inedita</i>, pp. 60, 315).</p>

(MS. Bodl. Digby 70) Bacon gives a sketch of his plan. The work was to

collection printed at Frankfurt in 1603<a name='fna_1351' id='fna_1351' href='#f_1351'><small>[1351]</small></a> in MSS. Bodl. Canonic. Misc.
No. 334, fol. 49 b; <i>ibid.</i>, No. 480, fol. 33; and E Musaeo 155, p. 689.
In each of these MSS. the same passage is quoted, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>Dicta fratris Rogerii Bacon in libro sex scienciarum in 3<sup>o</sup> gradu
sapiencie, ubi loquitur de bono corporis et de bono fortune et de bono
et honestate morum. (<i>Inc.</i>) In debito regimine corporis et
prolongatione vite ad ultimos terminos naturales ... miranda potestas
astronomie alkimie et perspective et scienciarum experimentalium.
Sciendum igitur est pro bono corporis quod homo fuit immortalis
naturaliter ... (<i>Expl.</i>) ut fiant sublimes operaciones et utilissime
in hoc mundo, etc.</p></div>

<p>Charles identifies the <i>Liber sex scientiarum</i> with the <i>Opus Minus</i>; but
this passage does not occur in the extant portion of the <i>Opus Minus</i>
which deals with the same subject and expresses the same ideas (<i>Opera
Ined.</i>, p. 370 <i>seq.</i>). It seems probable therefore that this passage is
an extract from the section on Alchemy in vol. iii. of the <i>Compendium
Philosophiae</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">Vol. I. <i>Grammar and Logic.</i> A portion of this has been edited by Brewer,
<i>Opera Ined.</i>, pp. 393-519, under the title <i>Compendium Studii
Philosophiae</i>. It was written in 1271, and contains an introduction on the
value of knowledge and the impediments to it, and the beginning of a
treatise on grammar.</p>

<p>It is, however, probable that these MS. fragments ought to be referred to
Bacon’s last work, the <i>Compendium Studii Theologiae</i>, rather than to the
<i>Compendium Philosophiae</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Compendium studii theologiae</i>, Bacon’s last work, bears the date 1292
(‘usque ad hunc annum Domini 1292’). Extracts from it are printed by
Charles, pp. 410-416. This work consisted of six parts or more.</p>

<p>Part i. <i>On the causes of error.</i></p>

<p>Part ii. <i>Logic and grammar in reference to theology.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">These two parts are extant (though not complete) in MS. British
Museum, Royal F vii. pp. 153-161: there is a long gap between pp. 154
and 155.</p></div>

<p>According to this MS. the work consisted of two parts:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">‘Incipit compendium studii theologiae et per consequens philosophiae
ut potest et debet servire theologicae facultati, et habet duas partes
principales; prima liberali communicatione sapientiae investigat omnes
causas errorum, et modos errandi in hoc studio.... Secunda pars
descendit ad veritates stabiliendas et ad errores cum diligentia
exterminandos.’</p></div>

<p>Part v. is preserved in Royal MS. 7 F. viii. f. 2 (sec. xiii) (almost
complete); it is a treatise on <i>optics</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><i>Incipit</i>: ‘Acto prologo istius quintae partis hujus voluminis quam
voco compendium studii theologiae, in quo quidem comprehendo in summa
intentionem totius operis, extra partem ejus signans omnia impedimenta
totius studii et remedia, nunc accedo ad tractatum exponens ea quae
necessaria sunt theologiae de perspectiva et de visu.’</p></div>

<p>Part vi. is mentioned in Part v.: it is to be a treatise, ‘<i>De
multiplicatione Specierum</i>.’</p>

<p>In Part iv. also the words ‘<i>in partibus sequentibus</i>’ occur.</p>

<p><i>Alchemy</i> was treated in the <i>Opus Minus</i> and in the <i>Compendium
Philosophiae</i>. Bacon divides it into (1) Speculative alchemy, ‘the science
of the generation of things from elements’; (2) Practical alchemy, ‘which
teaches us how to make noble metals and colours,’ &amp;c., and the art of
prolonging life (<i>Opus Tertium</i>, cap. xii). Wood mentions a treatise of
Bacon’s <i>De rerum generationibus</i>, of which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> had seen two copies
varying much. These may have been the versions in the <i>Opus Minus</i><a name='fna_1356' id='fna_1356' href='#f_1356'><small>[1356]</small></a>
and the <i>Compendium Philosophiae</i><a name='fna_1357' id='fna_1357' href='#f_1357'><small>[1357]</small></a>. A number of works on alchemy and
medicine ascribed to Bacon have been preserved, some of them are
undoubtedly genuine, others apocryphal.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Epistolae fratris Rogerii Baconis de secretis operibus artis et naturae
et de nullitate magiae</i> [or, <i>De mirabili potestate artis et naturae</i>].</p>

<p>The work consists of a letter or collection of letters in ten or eleven
chapters, the last five of which Charles considers doubtful, addressed
perhaps to William of Auvergne (who died in 1248), or to John of London,
whom Charles identifies with John of Basingstoke (d. 1252).</p>

<p><b>John</b>, Roger Bacon’s favourite pupil, was certainly not John of
London<a name='fna_1362' id='fna_1362' href='#f_1362'><small>[1362]</small></a>, or
John Peckham<a name='fna_1363' id='fna_1363' href='#f_1363'><small>[1363]</small></a>. On the other hand it is impossible to
identify him with any known scholastic doctor. It is not certain whether
he was a friar or whether he was ever at Oxford. About 1260 Roger Bacon
found him probably at Paris, as a poor boy of fifteen eager to learn, but
forced to beg his bread and to serve those who gave him the necessaries of
life<a name='fna_1364' id='fna_1364' href='#f_1364'><small>[1364]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘I caused him,’ says Roger<a name='fna_1365' id='fna_1365' href='#f_1365'><small>[1365]</small></a>, ‘to be taken care of and instructed
for the love of God.’</p></div>

<p>The boy repaid his master’s care. Wishing to send a fit interpreter of his
works to the Pope, Bacon writes<a name='fna_1366' id='fna_1366' href='#f_1366'><small>[1366]</small></a>,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘I chose a youth whom for five or six years I have had instructed in
languages and mathematics and optics, in which is all the difficulty
of what I send; and I instructed him gratis with my own mouth after I
received your command, feeling that I could not at present have
another messenger after my own heart.’</p></div>

<p>There was no one at Paris who knew so much of the roots of philosophy as
did <i>juvenis Johannes</i>; he was ‘a virgin, not knowing mortal sin,’ and ‘an
excellent keeper of secrets<a name='fna_1367' id='fna_1367' href='#f_1367'><small>[1367]</small></a>.’ John was sent to Clement with the
<i>Opus Majus</i> and other treatises<a name='fna_1368' id='fna_1368' href='#f_1368'><small>[1368]</small></a> in 1267, the other works, <i>Opus
Minus</i> and <i>Opus Tertium</i>, being sent later and probably by other
messengers. From this time we have no authentic information about him, and
do not know whether he fulfilled Bacon’s expectations:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘he has that which will enable him to surpass all the Latins, if he
lives to old age and builds on the foundations which he has<a name='fna_1369' id='fna_1369' href='#f_1369'><small>[1369]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p><b>Robert de Ware</b>, in Hertfordshire<a name='fna_1370' id='fna_1370' href='#f_1370'><small>[1370]</small></a>, entered the Order at Oxford
between 1265 and 1268. In the prologue of his only extant work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> addressed
to his younger brother John, he gives the following account of his
conversion<a name='fna_1371' id='fna_1371' href='#f_1371'><small>[1371]</small></a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was the eldest son of my father; at a tender age, tenderly beloved,
I was designed for a life of study. At length I came to Oxford, and
then I entered the Order of Friars Minors. At this my father was
exceedingly grieved, and did all in his power to force me to leave the
Order, sending my mother and brother and relatives and other friends
to me, with intreaties and promises; and, I am told, with the help of
some powerful persons, he made every exertion to secure my liberation
in the court of Ottobon, who was then acting as legate in
England<a name='fna_1372' id='fna_1372' href='#f_1372'><small>[1372]</small></a>. At length finding himself thwarted because I would not
give my consent, he became so embittered against me that he absolutely
refused to see me or speak with me, nor could any of my friends pacify
him. One day even, when I had come to his gates with my
companion-friar, and wished to enter, he refused me admittance by his
servants, drew his sword, and swore with a mighty oath that he would
kill me if I presumed to enter.</p></div>

<p>At length the father was stricken down by a mortal disease, and, warned in
a vision, he relented towards his son. The latter was summoned hastily
from London, and reconciled to his father, who before his death gave proof
of his devotion to the Order of St. Francis.</p>

<p><b>Walter de Landen</b>, <b>William Cornish</b>, <b>William de Wykham</b>, <b>Dyonisius</b>, and

controversy with the Dominicans in 1269. All that is known about them will

<p><b>Nicholas de Gulac</b> was at Oxford in 1269. Suffering from stone and
despairing of life, he at length prayed the Lord</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘to cure him by the merits of his martyr Earl Simon de Montfort.’</p></div>

<p>On the next morning as he rose from his bed ‘<i>ut commingeret</i>,’ the stone
fell at his feet, and he had no pain before or afterwards, being
completely cured on Easter Tuesday, 1269; to this miracle witness was
borne by the whole convent of Minorites at Oxford<a name='fna_1373' id='fna_1373' href='#f_1373'><small>[1373]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Laurence of Cornwall</b>, to whose miraculous recovery from fever, after

probably at Oxford about the same time<a name='fna_1374' id='fna_1374' href='#f_1374'><small>[1374]</small></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span><b>Stephanus Hibernicus</b>, called also <b>Stephen of Exeter</b> and <b>Stephen of Oxford</b>,
was born in 1246, and became a Minorite at ‘Mutifernana’ in 1263. These
facts are contained in the <i>Annales Montis Fernandi</i> (<i>sive Minoritarum

which may perhaps be still extant in an Italian library, is generally

either at Oxford or Paris. William de Mara appears also to have written in
favour of a strict observance of the Rule of St. Francis. In a dispute on
the interpretation of the Rule in 1310, Friar Ubertino de Casali, one of
the leaders of the ‘Spiritual’ party, quoted, in support of his views,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the opinion of St. Francis expressed in his Rule, and of Pope
Nicholas in his Declaration, of Friar Bonaventura in his Apologia, of
Friars Alexander and Rigaldus ... and of Friar John de Peckham in his

<p>Duns probably taught at Paris till 1307. Wadding, indeed, asserts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> that he
was sent to Cologne by the General Minister in 1305<a name='fna_1426' id='fna_1426' href='#f_1426'><small>[1426]</small></a>; but this is
almost impossible, and the description which Wadding gives of the scene is
derived from later and unhistorical tradition. The statement, however,
that he was appointed Regent by the friars in the General Chapter at
Toulouse in 1307 sounds more plausible<a name='fna_1427' id='fna_1427' href='#f_1427'><small>[1427]</small></a>; he may have been made the
first Regent at Paris, or he may have been sent at this time as lector or
Regent of the Franciscan schools at Cologne. At any rate there seems no
reason to distrust the notice of his death which Wadding quotes from the
list of friars who died at Cologne<a name='fna_1428' id='fna_1428' href='#f_1428'><small>[1428]</small></a>.</p>

<p>This entry, though certainly not contemporary, was probably derived from
some authentic record. Duns’ title of <i>Doctor Subtilis</i>, though it does
not seem to have been given him in his lifetime, is of considerable
antiquity. It is mentioned by Bartholomew of Pisa at the end of the
fourteenth century<a name='fna_1429' id='fna_1429' href='#f_1429'><small>[1429]</small></a>, and by the MS. Catalogue at Assisi, written in

<p>A collected edition of his works was printed at Lyons in 1639. Many of the

<p>‘<b>Philippus a Castellione Aretino</b>’ (Castello near Arezzo) in the Tuscan
province, is described by Wadding as, ‘<i>in theologia magister insignis
apud Oxonienses</i>.’ He flourished 1316, and wrote treatises on the poverty
of Christ<a name='fna_1445' id='fna_1445' href='#f_1445'><small>[1445]</small></a>.</p>

invincibilis<a name='fna_1446' id='fna_1446' href='#f_1446'><small>[1446]</small></a>,’ was born probably towards the end of the thirteenth
century. Whether he was a pupil of Duns Scotus is doubtful. He studied at
Oxford in the early years of the fourteenth century, and became B.D.
there<a name='fna_1447' id='fna_1447' href='#f_1447'><small>[1447]</small></a>. After this he was called to Paris, where he incepted as D.D.
Here he became acquainted with Marsiglio of Padua, over whom, according to
Pope Clement VI, he exercised a powerful influence<a name='fna_1448' id='fna_1448' href='#f_1448'><small>[1448]</small></a>. It is probable
that he was present at the famous Chapter of Perugia (1322), though he was
not (as is usually asserted) Provincial of England<a name='fna_1449' id='fna_1449' href='#f_1449'><small>[1449]</small></a>. From the first
he took a prominent part in the struggle against the Pope<a name='fna_1450' id='fna_1450' href='#f_1450'><small>[1450]</small></a>. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
imprisoned at Avignon about the end of 1327, and a process was instituted
against him in the Curia</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘because of many erroneous and heretical opinions which he had
written<a name='fna_1451' id='fna_1451' href='#f_1451'><small>[1451]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He remained in custody for seventeen weeks, and refused to modify his
opinions. It is said that a ‘rich and noble lady,’ in admiring recognition
of his staunch defence of ‘Evangelical Poverty,’ gave him 70
florins<a name='fna_1452' id='fna_1452' href='#f_1452'><small>[1452]</small></a>. On May 25, 1328, he fled from Avignon with Cesena, the
General Minister, and Bonagratia, joined the Emperor in Italy, and was
excommunicated<a name='fna_1453' id='fna_1453' href='#f_1453'><small>[1453]</small></a>. In Feb., 1330, he accompanied Louis to Bavaria, and
lived henceforth for the most part in the Franciscan Convent at
Munich<a name='fna_1454' id='fna_1454' href='#f_1454'><small>[1454]</small></a>. His literary activity was enormous, as may be seen from the
list of his works. He took a direct part in the affairs of state, being
present at the Councils of Rense and Frankfurt in 1338<a name='fna_1455' id='fna_1455' href='#f_1455'><small>[1455]</small></a>. From this
time his writings, hitherto largely theological, became more distinctly
political<a name='fna_1456' id='fna_1456' href='#f_1456'><small>[1456]</small></a>. In spite of excommunication, he continued to support the
Emperor’s cause till Louis’ death in 1347, and even later<a name='fna_1457' id='fna_1457' href='#f_1457'><small>[1457]</small></a>. But now
few only of the rebel friars were left: Cesena died in 1342, Bonagratia in
1347; and in 1349 Ockham sent back the seal of the Order to the orthodox
General Minister, and professed his desire to be reconciled to the
Church<a name='fna_1458' id='fna_1458' href='#f_1458'><small>[1458]</small></a>. Clement VI authorized the General Minister to absolve Ockham
and his associates on their confessing in set form their errors and
heresies, and promising to obey the Pope and his successors. Whether
Ockham subscribed the papal formula, nothing remains to show. The date of
his death is uncertain; it may however be concluded that he died at Munich
not before 1349<a name='fna_1459' id='fna_1459' href='#f_1459'><small>[1459]</small></a>.</p>

<p>In his Catalogue of the Bruges MSS., Haenel reads <i>ethicorum</i> instead of
<i>elenchorum</i>. Ockham seems to have written no distinct work on morals,
though another is attributed to him by a careless blunder. Caius College
MS. 200, § 3, contains, according to Smith’s catalogue, <i>Correcciones
Occami</i> (<i>Occani</i> in the old catalogue of 1697) <i>in Oculum moralem</i>. The
MS. really reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Correcciones octaui capituli de Ira. (<i>Inc.</i>) nisi tibi iratus
fuissem. Refert eciam Valerius. (<i>Expl.</i>) et ei reuelauit archana. Cum

<p>In other words, it is merely a fragment of chapter viii. of the well-known

<p>Part III, according to the scheme drawn up in the Prologue<a name='fna_1466' id='fna_1466' href='#f_1466'><small>[1466]</small></a>, was to
consist of nine treatises:</p>

<p>i. De potestate papae et cleri; ii. De potestate et juribus Romani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>

<p>The edition of 1495, of which Goldast’s is a reprint, ends at the 23rd
chapter of the 3rd book of Treatise II, with the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘passibilis et mortalis. Et haec de tertia parte Dialogorum pro nunc
tibi sufficiant.’</p></div>

<p>The last sentence Goldast surmises to be an addition of the editor,
Ascensius; but it occurs at the end of the Dijon MS., and both Goldast and
Riezler are probably mistaken in thinking that Ascensius had the whole
work before him and arbitrarily omitted Treatises III-IX<a name='fna_1467' id='fna_1467' href='#f_1467'><small>[1467]</small></a>. These were
probably never written. The Lambeth MS. (the only MS. in England which
contains Part III) and one version in the Mazarine MS. end with the words
‘passibilis et mortalis,’ like the printed editions, with the colophon (in
Lambeth MS.): ‘Dyalogorum venerabilis Guillermi Okam finis.’ The five
other MSS. in Paris, which contain Part III, leave out the last seven
chapters of the printed edition, and the Auxerre and Toulouse MSS.
likewise do not go beyond the third book of Treatise II. It is possible
that the Vatican and Basel MSS. may supply the remaining treatises; but
this is unlikely. About the year 1400, Peter d’Ailly, who must have had
exceptionally good opportunities for getting information<a name='fna_1468' id='fna_1468' href='#f_1468'><small>[1468]</small></a>, wrote a
summary of the <i>Dialogus</i><a name='fna_1469' id='fna_1469' href='#f_1469'><small>[1469]</small></a>. In this he omits Treatise I of Part III,
and concludes with the 16th chapter of the third book of Treatise II (like
the Parisian MSS.), adding:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘et non plus de hoc notabili opere potui reperire’<a name='fna_1470' id='fna_1470' href='#f_1470'><small>[1470]</small></a>.</p></div>

<p><b>Hugh de Willoughby</b> or <b>Wylluby</b>, S.T.P., was the Chancellor of the

<p><b>Peter de Gaieta</b> was elected in the General Chapter at Assisi, c. 1340, to
take the degree of B.D. and lecture on the <i>Sentences</i> at Oxford. When the
appointment of a friar to read the <i>Sentences</i> at Paris was discussed in
the General Chapter at Marseilles in 1343, Peter obtained many votes. In
the same year the degree of Master in the University of Naples was
conferred on him by the command of Pope Clement VI. He had previously

<p>There appear to have been two contemporary Minorites of the same name and

<p><b>Hermann of Cologne</b> was a contemporary and friend of John Lathbury at
Oxford, c. 1343<a name='fna_1483' id='fna_1483' href='#f_1483'><small>[1483]</small></a>. It is impossible to identify him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> any of the
other Hermanns who belonged to the Minorite Order at this time: e.g.
Hermann of Saxony, the lawyer (fl. 1337), or Hermann Gygas, the
historian<a name='fna_1484' id='fna_1484' href='#f_1484'><small>[1484]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Robert</b> (or <b>John</b>?) <b>Lamborne</b>,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘the son of a baron, and the last heir of that barony, entered the
Order in London<a name='fna_1485' id='fna_1485' href='#f_1485'><small>[1485]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He became confessor to Queen Isabella in 1327<a name='fna_1486' id='fna_1486' href='#f_1486'><small>[1486]</small></a>, and he still occupied
this office, ‘though he was so attenuated that he was almost or quite
blind,’ in 1343, when Clement VI granted him certain privileges<a name='fna_1487' id='fna_1487' href='#f_1487'><small>[1487]</small></a>. It
is however very doubtful whether he was ever at Oxford. The name occurs in
the Old Catalogue of Fellows of Merton College, under the reign of Edward
III. If the two are identical, Lamborne ought to be placed in the
Catalogue under Edward II, as he was clearly a friar in 1327; but there is
no good reason for assuming their identity: Robert Lamborn of Merton may
be a mistake for Reginald Lamborn<a name='fna_1488' id='fna_1488' href='#f_1488'><small>[1488]</small></a>. Friar John (?) Lamborne,
confessor to Queen Isabella, was buried in the choir of the Grey Friars
Church, London<a name='fna_1489' id='fna_1489' href='#f_1489'><small>[1489]</small></a>.</p>

Ashendon<a name='fna_1490' id='fna_1490' href='#f_1490'><small>[1490]</small></a>. He then entered the Benedictine Order, was at Eynsham

<p><b>John of Nottingham</b> was a member of the Oxford Convent in the middle of the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span><b>John Mardeslay</b>
or <b>Mardisle</b><a name='fna_1523' id='fna_1523' href='#f_1523'><small>[1523]</small></a>, probably a Yorkshireman, incepted as
D.D. at Oxford before 1355. Early in this year he disputed with the
Dominican, William Jordan, in the Chapter-house and Chancellor’s schools
at York, <i>de conceptione B. Mariae Virginis</i>, upholding the Immaculate
Conception<a name='fna_1524' id='fna_1524' href='#f_1524'><small>[1524]</small></a>. His manner of disputation gave offence, and the Chapter
of York issued letters testifying to his good conduct (April 10,
1355)<a name='fna_1525' id='fna_1525' href='#f_1525'><small>[1525]</small></a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘in putting forward his opinion he behaved amicably, modestly and
courteously, without introducing any abuse or improprieties
whatsoever.’</p></div>

<p>He was certainly an able debater. In 1374 he was summoned with three other
Doctors of Divinity to a council at Westminster, over which the Black
Prince and the Archbishop of Canterbury presided<a name='fna_1526' id='fna_1526' href='#f_1526'><small>[1526]</small></a>. The subject of
discussion was the right of England to refuse the papal tribute. The
Archbishop and bishops said: ‘The pope is lord of all, we cannot refuse
him this tribute.’ A monk of Durham brought forward the old argument about
the two swords. Mardeslay at once replied with the text ‘Put up again thy
sword into his place,’</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘showing that the two swords did not mean temporal and spiritual
power, and that Christ had not temporal diminion; which he proved by
the scriptures and gospels, by quotations from the doctors, by the
example of the religious who leave worldly goods, and by the
decretals; and he related how Boniface VIII claimed to be lord of all
kingdoms, and how he was repulsed in France and England.’</p></div>

<p>At the end of the day’s sitting, the Archbishop said, ‘There were good
counsels in England without the friars.’ The prince answered, ‘We have had
to call them because of your fatuity; your counsel would have lost us our
kingdom.’ The next day the papal party yielded. Between this date and 1380
Mardeslay was twenty-fifth Provincial Minister<a name='fna_1527' id='fna_1527' href='#f_1527'><small>[1527]</small></a>. The date of his
death is uncertain; he was buried at York<a name='fna_1528' id='fna_1528' href='#f_1528'><small>[1528]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Thomas of Portugal</b> studied at Oxford and Paris, c. 1360, and lectured at

<p><b>John Somer</b>, of the Convent of Bridgwater<a name='fna_1542' id='fna_1542' href='#f_1542'><small>[1542]</small></a>, was at Oxford in
1380<a name='fna_1543' id='fna_1543' href='#f_1543'><small>[1543]</small></a>. It does not appear whether he was a doctor either at this time
or afterwards. He enjoyed a great reputation as an astronomer, and is said
to have made use of the astronomical researches of Roger Bacon<a name='fna_1544' id='fna_1544' href='#f_1544'><small>[1544]</small></a>.
Chaucer refers to him in his treatise on the Astrolabe<a name='fna_1545' id='fna_1545' href='#f_1545'><small>[1545]</small></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>Somer is often coupled with the contemporary astronomer Nicholas of
Lynn<a name='fna_1546' id='fna_1546' href='#f_1546'><small>[1546]</small></a>, and it is possible that the following passage in Mercator’s
<i>Atlas</i>, which is supposed by Hakluyt and others to refer to Nicholas,
relates to John Somer<a name='fna_1547' id='fna_1547' href='#f_1547'><small>[1547]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘That which you see described in this table of those foure Iles is
taken from the journal of James Knox of Bolduc or the Busse<a name='fna_1548' id='fna_1548' href='#f_1548'><small>[1548]</small></a>, who

Mathematician, hath seene and composed the lands lying about the Pole,
and measured them with an astrolabe, and described them by a
Geometrical instrument.’</p></div>

<p>To this account John Dee<a name='fna_1550' id='fna_1550' href='#f_1550'><small>[1550]</small></a> adds the date 1360, and calls the friar a
‘Franciscan of Lynn’; Hakluyt (among other details) gives the name as
‘Nicholas de Lynna a Franciscan Friar.’ Nicholas of Lynn was a
Carmelite<a name='fna_1551' id='fna_1551' href='#f_1551'><small>[1551]</small></a>. On the other hand, supposing that the story has a good
foundation, it is more likely that the adventurous Friar was a native of
some seaport on the East coast than of a Western town like Bridgwater.</p>

<p><b>Hugh Karlelle</b> (Carlisle) and <b>Thomas Bernewell</b>, Oxford Minorites, were
among the Doctors of Theology who condemned Wiclif’s twenty-four
conclusions at the council held at Blackfriars, London, on May 21st,
1382<a name='fna_1552' id='fna_1552' href='#f_1552'><small>[1552]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>William Woodford</b> or <b>Widford</b> was one of the most determined opponents of
the Wicliffites. Wadding’s desire<a name='fna_1553' id='fna_1553' href='#f_1553'><small>[1553]</small></a> to claim this ‘extirpator of
heretics’ as a fellow-countryman has led him to identify William Woodford
with the comparatively unknown Friar William of Waterford. There is no
ground for this identification, and dates make it almost impossible<a name='fna_1554' id='fna_1554' href='#f_1554'><small>[1554]</small></a>.
In his earlier days at Oxford, probably when he was B.D., Woodford was on
friendly or even intimate terms with Wiclif. When the two were lecturing
on the Sentences, they carried on a courteous interchange of arguments and
opinions on Transubstantiation<a name='fna_1555' id='fna_1555' href='#f_1555'><small>[1555]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Woodford’s earliest extant work, of which the date is known, was composed
in 1381; it consists of theological lectures under the title, ‘<i>72
questiones de Sacramento Altaris</i>,’ in answer to Wiclif’s ‘Confession,’
and was written in great haste; these lectures were delivered, perhaps at
the Grey Friars London, within five weeks of the publication of the
‘Confession<a name='fna_1556' id='fna_1556' href='#f_1556'><small>[1556]</small></a>.’ He does not seem to have been D.D. at this time. On
the subject of his inception, a curious piece of information has been
preserved in a MS. of the 15th century;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘when he was going from London to Oxford to incept in theology he fell
among robbers, who took from him £40<a name='fna_1557' id='fna_1557' href='#f_1557'><small>[1557]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>In 1389 he was regent master in theology among the Minorites at Oxford,
and as such lectured in the schools of the Minorites against the adherents
of Wiclif<a name='fna_1558' id='fna_1558' href='#f_1558'><small>[1558]</small></a>. In 1390 when he also lectured at Oxford on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> same
subject, he was vicar of the Provincial Minister<a name='fna_1559' id='fna_1559' href='#f_1559'><small>[1559]</small></a>. Among his pupils
was Thomas Netter of Walden, afterwards Provincial of the Carmelites and
reputed author of the <i>Fasciculi Zizaniorum</i><a name='fna_1560' id='fna_1560' href='#f_1560'><small>[1560]</small></a>. Woodford appears now
to have resided mainly at the Grey Friars, London: in 1396 he obtained
from Boniface IX a papal sanction of the special privileges and graces
which he enjoyed in this convent; the chief of them was the right to a
private chamber or house<a name='fna_1561' id='fna_1561' href='#f_1561'><small>[1561]</small></a>. According to Bale and Pits he died, and
was buried at Colchester in 1397<a name='fna_1562' id='fna_1562' href='#f_1562'><small>[1562]</small></a>. His name however appears among
those buried in the choir of the Grey Friars Church, London.</p>

been written in the reign of Henry IV<a name='fna_1564' id='fna_1564' href='#f_1564'><small>[1564]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Thomas Kyngesbery</b>, <b>Kynbury</b>, <b>de Kyngusbury</b>, D.D. of Oxford, was
twenty-sixth Provincial Minister from 1379 or 1380 to 1390 or 1392<a name='fna_1573' id='fna_1573' href='#f_1573'><small>[1573]</small></a>.
At the beginning of his ministry, which coincided with the beginning of
the great Schism, he obtained from the Minorites, both in Provincial
Chapter and in the separate convents, an oath of obedience to Urban
VI<a name='fna_1574' id='fna_1574' href='#f_1574'><small>[1574]</small></a>. He appears to have been on terms of some intimacy with the royal
family<a name='fna_1575' id='fna_1575' href='#f_1575'><small>[1575]</small></a>, and about 1390 or 1392<a name='fna_1576' id='fna_1576' href='#f_1576'><small>[1576]</small></a> Richard II urged Boniface IX to
appoint him by provision to the next vacant bishopric: the king describes
him as</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘virum, prout experiencia certa et ejusdem fama preclaris diffusa
virtutibus nobis constat, sciencie, vite, ac morum honestate
perspicuum, et per omnia graciosum, nedum in sciencia speculativa, sed
in verbi dei predicacione multipliciter preexpertum.’</p></div>

<p>This recommendation appears to have had no result: perhaps Kyngesbery died
about this time. He was buried at Nottingham<a name='fna_1577' id='fna_1577' href='#f_1577'><small>[1577]</small></a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> Though none of his
writings remain, it may perhaps be inferred, from the fact that he is
twice mentioned in connexion with scientific works by Minorites, that he
was a patron of science in the Order<a name='fna_1578' id='fna_1578' href='#f_1578'><small>[1578]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John Tewkesbury</b>, Minorite, gave a treatise called ‘<i>Quatuor principalia

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘to the Community of the Friars Minors at Oxford, with the authority

<p><b>John Tyssyngton</b> subscribed the decree of the Chancellor Berton, condemning

master of the Friars Minors at this time<a name='fna_1581' id='fna_1581' href='#f_1581'><small>[1581]</small></a>. Soon afterwards Tyssyngton
made an elaborate reply to Wiclif’s <i>Confessio</i> on Transubstantiation in
the Franciscan Schools at Oxford, and issued the lecture as a
treatise<a name='fna_1582' id='fna_1582' href='#f_1582'><small>[1582]</small></a>; though this composition bears marks of undue haste, it was
considered to be of great value and was ordered to be kept in the
University Archives<a name='fna_1583' id='fna_1583' href='#f_1583'><small>[1583]</small></a>. In 1392 Tyssyngton was at the Council of
Stamford where the heresies of Henry Crompe, consisting chiefly of
conclusions against the friars, were condemned<a name='fna_1584' id='fna_1584' href='#f_1584'><small>[1584]</small></a>. He succeeded Thomas
Kyngesbery as twenty-seventh Provincial<a name='fna_1585' id='fna_1585' href='#f_1585'><small>[1585]</small></a>. Bale and Pits give 1395 as
the year of his death: he was buried at London<a name='fna_1586' id='fna_1586' href='#f_1586'><small>[1586]</small></a>.</p>

<p>The only work of his extant is the <i>Confessio contra confessionem Johannis
Wiclif</i>, above referred to.</p>

<p><b>John Schankton</b>, of the Order of Minors, appears to have been confessor of
John Okele, skinner of Oxford. The latter, in his will dated October 20th,
1390, left Schankton 20<i>s.</i> a year for three years,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘to celebrate masses for my soul and the souls of all those to whom I

<p><b>Nicholas Fakenham</b> (Norfolk) enjoyed the favour and patronage of Richard
II. He was doctor of Oxford and twenty-eighth Provincial Minister of the
Order in 1395. On the 5th of November in that year, on the occasion
apparently of his inception, he ‘determined’ at Oxford on the papal schism
by command of the king. This lecture has been preserved<a name='fna_1594' id='fna_1594' href='#f_1594'><small>[1594]</small></a>; the
introduction may be given here, somewhat abbreviated.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>‘Our mother, the Roman Church, is full of troubles and calamities. Yet
her daughter, the University of Paris, alone has tried to comfort her:
Paris has borne the burden and heat of the day, and may well upbraid
us. We too must work for the union of the Church and the reformation
of peace. I therefore, promoted to the degree of Master though
unworthily, through zeal for the religion of Christ and for the Church
of God, and by reason of the command of our lord the King, propose to
move some matters pertaining to the proposition, in the form of a
question, not as a formal <i>determinator</i>, but rather as a friendly
speaker (<i>familiaris concionator</i>), now on one side, now on the other,
now as an impartial person. In these writings I wish to say nothing
against the Catholic Church or good morals or Pope Boniface; if I do
so inadvertently I submit to the Chancellor and others in
authority.&mdash;Touching the reformation of the desolate Church, I ask
whether there is any reasonable way of restoring it to its original
unity.’</p></div>

<p>Then he treats learnedly about the schismatical churches and shows that
the Church can be reformed only by the punishment of those who have
disturbed its peace&mdash;namely, the Cardinals.</p>

<p>He ceased to be Minister some years before his death. In 1405 he was with
Friar J. Mallaert appointed papal commissary to examine into the charges
made by the English Minorites against John Zouche, then Provincial
Minister. The commissaries deposed Zouche; and on the latter’s
reappointment by papal authority, refused to obey him<a name='fna_1595' id='fna_1595' href='#f_1595'><small>[1595]</small></a>. According to
Bale he died 1407<a name='fna_1596' id='fna_1596' href='#f_1596'><small>[1596]</small></a>; he was buried at Colchester<a name='fna_1597' id='fna_1597' href='#f_1597'><small>[1597]</small></a>.</p>

<p>At the end of the ‘<i>determinatio</i>’ in Harl. MS., 3768 (fol. 196) is the
note:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘et incipiunt alie conclusiones ejusdem de eodem scismate cum epistola

<p>Some ‘conclusions’ then follow.</p>

<p><b>(Richard) Tryvytlam</b> or <b>Trevytham</b> seems to have flourished about 1400;
Hearne suggests that he was the same as Robert Finingham, a Franciscan who
lived about 1460<a name='fna_1598' id='fna_1598' href='#f_1598'><small>[1598]</small></a>, but this is a quite unwarranted assumption.
Tryvytlam is only known from his rhymed Latin poem, ‘<i>De laude
Universitatis Oxoniae</i>,’ a defence of the friars and attack on the monks.
From the poem it is clear that he was an Oxford friar, and one line points
to his having been a Franciscan:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Minorum ordinem proclamat impium,’ etc.<a name='fna_1599' id='fna_1599' href='#f_1599'><small>[1599]</small></a>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>Among the assailants of the mendicants he mentions by name Ughtred of
Durham, who flourished in the reign of Richard II. His poem has been
edited by Hearne (Oxon. 1729), from a fifteenth century MS. then in the
possession of Roger Gale, Esq.</p>

<p><b>William Butler</b> or <b>Botellere</b> was regent master of the Minorites at Oxford
in 1401, when he lectured against the translation of the Bible into
English<a name='fna_1606' id='fna_1606' href='#f_1606'><small>[1606]</small></a>. He occurs as the thirtieth Provincial Minister and
successor to John Zouche<a name='fna_1607' id='fna_1607' href='#f_1607'><small>[1607]</small></a>. He was probably the person elected by the

Zouche<a name='fna_1608' id='fna_1608' href='#f_1608'><small>[1608]</small></a>. Though the latter was afterwards restored, he does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> seem
to have been generally recognised in England, and was in 1408 made Bishop
of Llandaff<a name='fna_1609' id='fna_1609' href='#f_1609'><small>[1609]</small></a>. Butler’s tenure of office seems to have been reckoned
from 1408. A new ordinance was made at this time that no Provincial of the
Minorites should remain in office more than six years<a name='fna_1610' id='fna_1610' href='#f_1610'><small>[1610]</small></a>. William
Butler resigned in 1413 or 1414, but was reinstated by Pope John
XXIII<a name='fna_1611' id='fna_1611' href='#f_1611'><small>[1611]</small></a>. Whether he actually entered on his duties again does not
appear. The date of his death is unknown. Bale and Pits state that he was
buried at Reading<a name='fna_1612' id='fna_1612' href='#f_1612'><small>[1612]</small></a>. The Catalogue of Illustrious Franciscans, as
quoted by Leland, calls him ‘Flos universitatis temporibus suis.’</p>

<p>Besides the treatise against the English translation of the Bible (Merton
Coll. MS. 67) he is said to have written <i>De indulgentiis papalibus</i>.
<i>Inc.</i> ‘Articulus pro finali cessatione lecture sentenciarum’<a name='fna_1613' id='fna_1613' href='#f_1613'><small>[1613]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Vincent Boys</b>, D.D. of Oxford, was elected thirty-first Provincial on the
voluntary retirement of W. Butler in 1413. Butler was reinstated by the
Pope and the election of Boys quashed; but no stigma was to attach to the
latter<a name='fna_1614' id='fna_1614' href='#f_1614'><small>[1614]</small></a>. Tanner mentions a David Boys, Carmelite, c. 1450<a name='fna_1615' id='fna_1615' href='#f_1615'><small>[1615]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Peter Russel</b> was D.D. of Oxford<a name='fna_1616' id='fna_1616' href='#f_1616'><small>[1616]</small></a>, and taught also in Spain. On
November 25th, 1399, Martin, king of Aragon, gave him power</p>

office in 1420, having presumably held it for six years<a name='fna_1618' id='fna_1618' href='#f_1618'><small>[1618]</small></a>.</p>

<p>He wrote or lectured in defence of Mendicancy. MS. Bodleian, Digby, 90, f.

<p><b>Robert Colman</b> is said to have been a Minorite of Norwich<a name='fna_1624' id='fna_1624' href='#f_1624'><small>[1624]</small></a>. He was
S.T.P. and Chancellor of the University in 1419<a name='fna_1625' id='fna_1625' href='#f_1625'><small>[1625]</small></a>. In 1428 he attended
as Minorite D.D. the diocesan synod at Norwich, where inquisition was made
into the heresies of William Whyte<a name='fna_1626' id='fna_1626' href='#f_1626'><small>[1626]</small></a>. He is said to have induced
Walter Clopton, Knight, chief justice of England, to enter the Order in
his old age<a name='fna_1627' id='fna_1627' href='#f_1627'><small>[1627]</small></a>. Leland says:</p>

<p><b>Matthias Döring</b> studied at Oxford in his youth<a name='fna_1629' id='fna_1629' href='#f_1629'><small>[1629]</small></a>, and perhaps entered
the Franciscan Order there. He was certainly a Minorite in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> 1422, when he
matriculated at Erfurt as ‘lector Minorum’<a name='fna_1630' id='fna_1630' href='#f_1630'><small>[1630]</small></a>. He seems to have been
lecturing in the Franciscan Convent at Erfurt some time before this event;
his lectures on the first book of the Sentences were finished on April
21st, 1422. He may have been at Oxford about 1415 and perhaps took the
degree of B.D. there. In 1423, at any rate, he appears as B.D., and became
Provincial Minister of Saxony in 1427<a name='fna_1631' id='fna_1631' href='#f_1631'><small>[1631]</small></a>. He was one of the
representatives of the University of Erfurt at the Council of Basel in
1432, where he played a leading part<a name='fna_1632' id='fna_1632' href='#f_1632'><small>[1632]</small></a>. In 1433 he was sent by the
Council as ambassador to Eric, king of Denmark. Soon after this he
returned to Erfurt. In 1438 he wrote a pamphlet entitled ‘<i>Confutatio
primatus papae</i>,’ with the object of enlisting the support of the secular
princes on the side of the Council against the pope. He seems himself to
have been a trusted friend of his Margraf, Frederic of Thüringen.</p>

<p>In his relations to his Order he appears as a consistent champion of the
Conventuals against the stricter Observants. In 1443 he was elected
General Minister of the former, and held the office till 1449. In 1455 his
name occurs among the Conventual Provincial Ministers; after a struggle
with the Archbishop of Magdeburg on behalf of the Conventuals he resigned
the Provincialate in 1461, and retired to Kyritz, leaving the Archbishop
in possession of the field. Döring however seems to have been left in
peace till his death, July 24th, 1469. His chief works besides the
treatise already mentioned were a <i>defence of Nicholas de Lyra</i> against
Paul Burgos, written between 1434 and 1440 (printed several times; e.g. at

<p><b>William Russell</b>, ‘of the Convent of Stamford in the diocese of Lincoln,’
argued that a religious might lie with a woman without mortal sin; this
thesis was discussed and condemned in the Convocation of Canterbury at St.
Paul’s on October 12th, 1424, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> Russell submitted to the decision of
the clergy<a name='fna_1633' id='fna_1633' href='#f_1633'><small>[1633]</small></a>. On May 15th, 1425, he again appeared before Convocation
to answer the charge of having publicly held and preached on Jan. 28th,
1425, that tithes need not be paid to the parish priest, but might be
applied by the tithe-payer ‘<i>in pios usus pauperum</i>’<a name='fna_1634' id='fna_1634' href='#f_1634'><small>[1634]</small></a>. At this time
Russell was warden of Friars Minors of London<a name='fna_1635' id='fna_1635' href='#f_1635'><small>[1635]</small></a>. At first he tried to
defend his doctrine, then submitted. The Archbishop enjoined on him, as a
penance, that he should next Sunday after service solemnly renounce his
error in set form<a name='fna_1636' id='fna_1636' href='#f_1636'><small>[1636]</small></a> at Paul’s Cross. At the time appointed Russell did
not appear and was in consequence excommunicated. The proceedings against
him dragged on for some time. On July 11th, a letter of the University of
Oxford in condemnation of his doctrines was exhibited, and later a similar
letter from Cambridge; and on the 13th it was decreed</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘that he should be judged and condemned as a heretic and schismatic.’</p></div>

<p>Meanwhile, Russell, now no longer warden, fled to Rome ‘to defende the
forsaide erronye doctrine’<a name='fna_1637' id='fna_1637' href='#f_1637'><small>[1637]</small></a>. On August 12th, 1425, he was imprisoned
by order of the Pope, first in the Pope’s, then in the ‘Soldan’s’ prison.
The following January he escaped from prison and fled to England, where he
was received for one night by the Friars Minors of London. He seems to
have remained at large for more than a year. He surrendered or was
captured in March, 1427, and on the 21st of that month, in accordance with
the papal decision, he read in English a complete recantation of his
doctrine on tithes at Paul’s Cross<a name='fna_1638' id='fna_1638' href='#f_1638'><small>[1638]</small></a>, and was then handed over to the
Bishop of London to be imprisoned during the Pope’s pleasure. He was at
liberty again in 1429 when he incepted as D.D. at Oxford, and paid £10 to
the University instead of giving a feast to the Regents<a name='fna_1639' id='fna_1639' href='#f_1639'><small>[1639]</small></a>. The
University showed its hatred of his teaching by adding to the oaths which
had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> taken by every inceptor in every faculty<a name='fna_1640' id='fna_1640' href='#f_1640'><small>[1640]</small></a>, a disavowal of
Russell’s teaching on tithes<a name='fna_1641' id='fna_1641' href='#f_1641'><small>[1641]</small></a>. The oath has already been quoted at
length in Chapter VI.</p>

<p><b>William de Melton</b> in 1427 went about the country preaching against tithes,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘and teaching seditious doctrines among the common people in many
places by uncircumcised words.’</p></div>

<p>He had probably taken a degree at Oxford, as the University was appealed
to to stop his preaching. The University wrote to the Duke of Gloucester
and the King’s Council, and secured his arrest. Melton was brought back to
Oxford, and is said to have recanted over and over again on his
knees<a name='fna_1642' id='fna_1642' href='#f_1642'><small>[1642]</small></a>. He is probably the same as William Melton of the Friars
Minors, S.T.P.<a name='fna_1643' id='fna_1643' href='#f_1643'><small>[1643]</small></a>, who was preaching at York in 1426, on the subject of
the mystery plays.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘He commended the play to the people, affirming that it was good in

<p><b>Roger Donwe</b> or <b>Days</b>, D.D. of Oxford, became thirty-fifth Provincial
Minister in succession to John David between 1426 and 1430; in the latter
year he was ‘for just causes deposed by the Minister General.’ He was

<p><b>John Feckyngtone</b>, ‘of the Order of Minors in Oxford,’ was one of the two
Rectors of Balliol College in 1433, his colleague being Richard Roderham,
S.T.P. The Rectors, having, at the instance of the College, inquired into
the working of the statutes, recommended a change in the clause of the
first statute which provided that the Master of the College, if he
received a benefice of the clear annual value of £10, was thereby
incapacitated from holding his office.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘In witness whereof, because our seals are known to few, we have

<p><b>John Whytwell</b>, Minorite, on February 7th, 1448/9, was allowed to count
twenty oppositions <i>pro completa oppositione</i><a name='fna_1650' id='fna_1650' href='#f_1650'><small>[1650]</small></a>. On January 25th,
1449/50, it was decided in solemn congregation, that one-half of the £10
paid by this friar at his inception as D.D. should be placed in the
Rothbury Chest to be used for the partial redemption of the University
jewels, and that the other half should be given to the proctors in payment
of certain sums owed to them by the University<a name='fna_1651' id='fna_1651' href='#f_1651'><small>[1651]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John Argentine</b> supplicated for B.D. on October 20th, 1449, on the ground
that he had studied philosophy for nine years, theology for seven, and had
opposed and responded formally four times. The grace was conceded<a name='fna_1652' id='fna_1652' href='#f_1652'><small>[1652]</small></a>.
In 1470 a John Argentine challenged and disputed against all the Regents
of Cambridge; he does not appear to have been a friar<a name='fna_1653' id='fna_1653' href='#f_1653'><small>[1653]</small></a>: he was
probably the John Argentine, M.D. and D.D., who was physician to the
princes Edward and Arthur, and held several prebends and livings in the
dioceses of Ely, Lichfield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> Wells, and London, between 1487 and
1508<a name='fna_1654' id='fna_1654' href='#f_1654'><small>[1654]</small></a>. One of the same name, with the degree of B.D. was Provost of
King’s College, Cambridge, from 1501 to 1507<a name='fna_1655' id='fna_1655' href='#f_1655'><small>[1655]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Antony de Valle</b> or <b>Vallibus</b> was admitted B.D., February 6th,
1449/50<a name='fna_1656' id='fna_1656' href='#f_1656'><small>[1656]</small></a>. He incepted as D.D. before March 22nd, 1451/2, when he was

<p><b>John David</b>, on March 4th, 1450/1, was allowed to curtail his period of
opponency and take the B.D. degree, on condition that he would lecture on
the first book of Isaiah in the public schools<a name='fna_1658' id='fna_1658' href='#f_1658'><small>[1658]</small></a>. He became D.D.
before June 5th, 1454, when he received permission</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘to resume his ordinary lectures after the feast of St. Thomas next

<p>Another of the same name was lecturer to the Franciscans of Hereford

benefactor of the friars of Oxford and elsewhere<a name='fna_1661' id='fna_1661' href='#f_1661'><small>[1661]</small></a>. This Carrewe is
probably identical with the Friar <b>David Carron</b>, S.T.P., who, in 1448, was
with Friar Nicholas Walshe, S.T.B., appointed commissioner to elect a
Provincial of the Minorites in Ireland on the deposition of William
O’Really: their choice fell on Gilbert Walshe, a relative of Nicholas, but
O’Really was afterwards reinstated by the Pope<a name='fna_1662' id='fna_1662' href='#f_1662'><small>[1662]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John Foxholes</b> (co. York) on April 14th, 1451, was allowed to count

which he was bound to deliver by the University statutes<a name='fna_1663' id='fna_1663' href='#f_1663'><small>[1663]</small></a>; this was
equivalent to a supplication for B.D.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>We venture to identify John Foxholes with <b>John Foxalls</b> or <b>Foxal</b>, Minorite,

<p><b>John Sunday</b>, on May 17th, 1453, was allowed to count ‘opposition in each

oppositions, as equivalent to the statutable opposition of one year<a name='fna_1668' id='fna_1668' href='#f_1668'><small>[1668]</small></a>.
On June 10th, he was admitted B.D.<a name='fna_1669' id='fna_1669' href='#f_1669'><small>[1669]</small></a> On February 5th, 1453/4, after

<p><b>William Goddard</b> the elder, ‘Doctor Oxoniae Disertissimus,’ succeeded
Thomas Radnor, according to the Register of the Grey Friars of London, as
thirty-eighth Provincial Minister<a name='fna_1672' id='fna_1672' href='#f_1672'><small>[1672]</small></a>.
Radnor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> minister in 1438, and
it is probable that Goddard was not his immediate successor. At any rate,
the latter was a leading man among the friars, and probably provincial
minister between 1450 and 1460. Bishop Reginald Pecock wrote a letter
addressed <i>Doctori ordinis fratrum minorum Godard</i>, in which</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘he calls the modern preachers pulpit-bawlers (<i>clamatores in
pulpitis</i>)’<a name='fna_1673' id='fna_1673' href='#f_1673'><small>[1673]</small></a>.</p></div>

<p>A little later, the friar had his revenge. On November 27th, 1457, Pecock,
being convicted of heretical opinions, abjured at Paul’s Cross.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘And doctor William Gooddard the elder, that was provinciall of the
Grey-freeres, apechyd hym of hys erysys’<a name='fna_1674' id='fna_1674' href='#f_1674'><small>[1674]</small></a>.</p></div>

<p>He was living in London many years after this event. In the will, dated
March 6th, 1471/2, of John Crosby, ‘citezein and grocer and alderman of
London,’ is the clause:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Item, I bequeth to maister Godard thelder doctoure of dyvynyte to
pray for my soule C<sup>s</sup>’<a name='fna_1675' id='fna_1675' href='#f_1675'><small>[1675]</small></a>.</p></div>

<p>Similar bequests follow to the prior of the Austin Friars of London and to
the provincial of the same Order. From this entry it would appear that
Goddard was not provincial of the Minorites in 1472. From the
distinguished position which he evidently occupied in 1457, and from the
passage in the Grey Friars’ Chronicle quoted above, it might be assumed
that he had already held the office and retired. But William Goddard is
mentioned as provincial in a record dated Dorchester, October 4th,
1485<a name='fna_1676' id='fna_1676' href='#f_1676'><small>[1676]</small></a>. Was this Goddard <i>senior</i> or <i>junior</i>? For there were two
Franciscans of this name in the fifteenth century. There is nothing to
show that the younger Goddard was ever provincial minister; he was warden
of the London convent, but was not buried in the choir, where all the
ministers mentioned in the Register were buried<a name='fna_1677' id='fna_1677' href='#f_1677'><small>[1677]</small></a>. Further, the
Register of the Grey Friars states that the younger Goddard died on
September 26th, 1485, i.e. before the record was drawn up. The Register
is, however, in the matter of dates absolutely untrustworthy. Without
further evidence it seems impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> to decide with certainty which of
the two was provincial in 1485; and, if it was the elder, whether he held
office twice. William Goddard the elder was buried in the choir of the
Franciscan Church in London.</p>

<p><b>John Tinmouth</b>, or <b>Maynelyn</b>, Franciscan of Lynn, was educated at Oxford and
Cambridge. He was warden of the Grey Friars of Colchester in 1493. In 1511
he resigned the rectory of Ludgershall, Bucks. In 1510 he had been made
suffragan bishop of Lincoln with the title bishop of Argos; he held this
office till his death. He was vicar of Boston in Lincolnshire in 1518. In
the same year he became a brother, and in 1579 Alderman, of the Gild of
Corpus Christi in Boston. He died in 1524, desiring in his will to be
buried at Boston,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘to the end that his loving parishioners, when they should happen to
see his grave and tomb, might be sooner moved to pray for his soul.’</p></div>

<p>He left £5 to each of the Franciscan houses at Lynn, Oxford, and
Cambridge. He is said to have written a life of St. Botolph<a name='fna_1732' id='fna_1732' href='#f_1732'><small>[1732]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Alexander Barclay</b>, D.D. of Oxford, the translator and part-author of the

<p><b>Henry Standish</b>, of Standish in Lancashire, was D.D. of Oxford, and appears
to have studied also at Cambridge<a name='fna_1734' id='fna_1734' href='#f_1734'><small>[1734]</small></a>. He was one of the court preachers
at the beginning of Henry VIII’s reign, and frequently received payments
for his services: the earliest grant to him in the State Papers was a sum
of 20<i>s.</i> for preaching in 1511<a name='fna_1735' id='fna_1735' href='#f_1735'><small>[1735]</small></a>. In 1514 the King gave £10 to Dr.
Standisshe and the Friars Minors for charges at the general chapter to be
holden at Bridgwater<a name='fna_1736' id='fna_1736' href='#f_1736'><small>[1736]</small></a>. The next year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> the friar was in debt to the
extent of 100 marcs<a name='fna_1737' id='fna_1737' href='#f_1737'><small>[1737]</small></a>. Standish was probably at this time warden of
the Grey Friars of London<a name='fna_1738' id='fna_1738' href='#f_1738'><small>[1738]</small></a>. The time during which he was Provincial
Minister cannot be determined<a name='fna_1739' id='fna_1739' href='#f_1739'><small>[1739]</small></a>. In 1515 he attended a council of
divines and temporal lords summoned by the King to consider a sermon
preached by Richard Kidderminster, Abbat of Winchcombe, on benefit of
clergy. The Abbat maintained that a recent act which deprived ‘murderers,
robbers of churches, and housebreakers’ of their clergy if they were not
in holy orders, was contrary to the law of God and the liberties of the
Church. The Franciscan doctor defended the act, arguing that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘it was not against the liberty of the Church, because it was for the
weal of the whole realm.’</p></div>

<p>Soon afterwards he was summoned to answer for his opinion before
Convocation. He appealed to the King, and Henry quickly brought the
bishops to submission by an assertion of the royal supremacy and a threat
of <i>praemunire</i><a name='fna_1740' id='fna_1740' href='#f_1740'><small>[1740]</small></a>. Standish thus won the goodwill of the court; he
possessed the confidence of the people. The feeling against foreign
traders was now very bitter in London, and in 1517 one John Lincoln,
acting as spokesman of the citizens, urged the warden of the Franciscans</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘to take part with the commonalty against the strangers’</p></div>

<p>in a sermon he was to deliver on Easter Monday<a name='fna_1741' id='fna_1741' href='#f_1741'><small>[1741]</small></a>. Standish refused,
wisely, as the event showed; for an inflammatory sermon the next day
resulted in a serious riot. In 1518 Standish obtained the bishopric of St.
Asaph by royal influence, in spite of the opposition of Wolsey<a name='fna_1742' id='fna_1742' href='#f_1742'><small>[1742]</small></a>. In
1524 he was sent as royal ambassador to Denmark<a name='fna_1743' id='fna_1743' href='#f_1743'><small>[1743]</small></a>. In 1528 he was one
of the ‘counsellors appointed for the hearing of poor men’s causes in the
King’s Court of Requests’<a name='fna_1744' id='fna_1744' href='#f_1744'><small>[1744]</small></a>.</p>

<p>His administration of his diocese was not altogether blameless. His
Vicar-General, Sir Robert ap Rice, was indicted for extortions on the
King’s tenants in 1533, and relatives of Sir Robert had, three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
previously, been indicted for maintaining thieves and had not yet been
punished<a name='fna_1745' id='fna_1745' href='#f_1745'><small>[1745]</small></a>.</p>

<p>But Standish is best known as a champion, probably the foremost champion,
of the ‘Old Learning’ in England. He was, there can be little doubt, the
Franciscan theologian who in 1516 tried to organize a combined critical
attack on the writings of Erasmus<a name='fna_1746' id='fna_1746' href='#f_1746'><small>[1746]</small></a>. It was some years later&mdash;in
1520&mdash;that he preached at Paul’s Cross against Erasmus’ edition of the New
Testament, and inveighed against his writings in conversation at
court<a name='fna_1747' id='fna_1747' href='#f_1747'><small>[1747]</small></a>. He consequently became the object of the famous scholar’s
satire and invective, and his memory has suffered accordingly.</p>

<p>In 1528, when the royal divorce suit was proceeding, he became Katharine’s
chief counsellor, being apparently chosen by the queen herself<a name='fna_1748' id='fna_1748' href='#f_1748'><small>[1748]</small></a>.
During the long trial, however, he showed little of the boldness which
characterised Fisher’s conduct, and Katharine seems not unreasonably to
have entertained some suspicion of his sincerity<a name='fna_1749' id='fna_1749' href='#f_1749'><small>[1749]</small></a>. He was present at
the coronation of Anne Boleyn, June 1533<a name='fna_1750' id='fna_1750' href='#f_1750'><small>[1750]</small></a>. That he was willing to
admit the royal supremacy<a name='fna_1751' id='fna_1751' href='#f_1751'><small>[1751]</small></a> is not surprising. He proposed to add to
the King’s Articles (which required the surrender, by Convocation, of the
legislative powers of the clergy), the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Provided that the King allow those constitutions which are not
contrary to the law of God or of the realm to be put in execution as
before<a name='fna_1752' id='fna_1752' href='#f_1752'><small>[1752]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He died on July 9th, 1535<a name='fna_1753' id='fna_1753' href='#f_1753'><small>[1753]</small></a>. His will is dated July 3rd, 1535<a name='fna_1754' id='fna_1754' href='#f_1754'><small>[1754]</small></a>.
He desired to be buried ‘inter fratres Minores’ (London?).</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Item pro sepultura mea quadraginta libras. Item pro Tumba erigenda
xiij<sup>li</sup>. vj<sup>s</sup> viij<sup>d</sup> in ecclesia fratrum minorum ubi contigerit
corpus meum quiescere. Item pro exhibicione scolarium in Universitate
Oxonie quadraginta libras. Item pro edificatione Insule ecclesie
fratrum Minorum Oxonie quadraginta libras.’</p></div>

<p>His bequest of £5 to buy books for the Oxford Franciscans, and his
appointment of two executors to distribute his own library should make us
hesitate to accept unreservedly the charge of ‘gross ignorance’ which
Erasmus brings against him<a name='fna_1755' id='fna_1755' href='#f_1755'><small>[1755]</small></a>. Among other legacies may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> noticed £40
to the Church of St. Asaph ‘<i>pro pavimento chori</i>,’ 20 marcs to the
Carmelites of Denbigh ‘to build their cloister,’ £10 to the Minorites of
London for thirty trentals, £40 to the parish church of ‘Standisshe,’ and
a messuage in ‘Wrixham’ to Nicholas Rygbye. The will was not allowed to
pass uncontested; ‘for the law is plain, that when a religious man is made
a bishop, he cannot make a will’<a name='fna_1756' id='fna_1756' href='#f_1756'><small>[1756]</small></a>. Cromwell seems to have exacted

<p><b>John Brown</b>, having studied for twelve years, supplicated for B.D. on Jan.
22, 1510/1; he obtained the Chancellor’s license Nov. 19, 1512. In June
1513, he supplicated as B.D. for D.D., after eighteen years’ study. The

was afterwards increased to four nobles,</p>

<p>It is curious that a scholar should, before attaining the degree of

after fourteen years’ study (?)<a name='fna_1787' id='fna_1787' href='#f_1787'><small>[1787]</small></a>. Early in the next year he applied

he would proceed at the next act, say five masses for the regents, and
interpret the epistles of Paul to the Galatians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> before Easter. He does
not appear to have fulfilled these conditions: on May 23, the same grace
was conceded,</p>

the Grey Friars of Boston: he was, however, to continue to deliver his
ordinary lectures till All Saints’ Day<a name='fna_1789' id='fna_1789' href='#f_1789'><small>[1789]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>David Williams</b>, B.D., was allowed to incept, after fourteen years’ study,

and failed to incept at the ensuing Congregation<a name='fna_1793' id='fna_1793' href='#f_1793'><small>[1793]</small></a>. Having secured a

<p><b>Thomas Frances</b>, B.D., had grace to incept (after sixteen years’ study) on
condition of paying 40<i>d.</i> to mend the staff of the sub-bedell of arts,
preaching at St. Paul’s within two years, and preaching an examinatory
sermon before his degree (Jan. 24, 1520/1). He incepted on July 9, 1521,
having three days before obtained a dispensation from his necessary
regency,</p>

<p>He was admitted B.D. in June, 1523, and obtained grace to incept in May,

<p>and that he should incept before Easter<a name='fna_1800' id='fna_1800' href='#f_1800'><small>[1800]</small></a>. He failed to do so, and on
July 11, 1525, was permitted to pay £5, instead of his full <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>composition,

<p><b>Nicholas de Burgo</b> an Italian Minorite, native of Florence, B.D. of Paris,
was incorporated B.D. of Oxford in Feb. 1522/3<a name='fna_1804' id='fna_1804' href='#f_1804'><small>[1804]</small></a>. A year later (Jan.
25) he supplicated for the Doctor’s degree, stating that he had studied
seventeen years, seven of them having been spent in Oxford<a name='fna_1805' id='fna_1805' href='#f_1805'><small>[1805]</small></a>. On the
same day he prayed that his composition to the University on his inception
might be remitted<a name='fna_1806' id='fna_1806' href='#f_1806'><small>[1806]</small></a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Causa est quia est alienigena et anglice nescit, preterea multos hic

gratia est concessa sic quod legat unum librum sacre theologie publice

<p>A few days later he was dispensed from nearly all his necessary regency,
promising to preach ‘on some day when there shall be a general
procession<a name='fna_1807' id='fna_1807' href='#f_1807'><small>[1807]</small></a>.’ In March, being ‘unable to procure all that was
necessary to him,’ he was allowed to postpone his inception till after
Easter, paying a fine of 20<i>s.</i> to the University. The fine was afterwards
remitted and a sermon substituted, as Nicholas alleged extreme poverty
(June 20)<a name='fna_1808' id='fna_1808' href='#f_1808'><small>[1808]</small></a>. He incepted shortly after this. His dispensation from
necessary regency seems to have lapsed, for in Oct. he obtained leave to
absent himself for ten ‘legible’ days,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘because he had been bidden to preach a sermon within twenty days,’</p></div>

<p>and had not time to fulfil the duties of regent<a name='fna_1809' id='fna_1809' href='#f_1809'><small>[1809]</small></a>. He preached at St.
Peter’s-in-the-East on Ash Wednesday, 1528<a name='fna_1810' id='fna_1810' href='#f_1810'><small>[1810]</small></a>. He was patronized by
Wolsey, but whether he came to England at the Cardinal’s invitation is
doubtful. In Nov. 1528, ‘Fryer Nicholas of Oxford’ received £5 as a reward
from Wolsey<a name='fna_1811' id='fna_1811' href='#f_1811'><small>[1811]</small></a>. In 1529 the King desired that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> friar should have a
benefice<a name='fna_1812' id='fna_1812' href='#f_1812'><small>[1812]</small></a>; payments to him from the Privy Purse and other sources are
frequently found<a name='fna_1813' id='fna_1813' href='#f_1813'><small>[1813]</small></a>. The Italian friar had made himself useful by
advocating the King’s divorce<a name='fna_1814' id='fna_1814' href='#f_1814'><small>[1814]</small></a>. He was perhaps the</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Franciscan, who was one of the chief writers in favour of the King,’</p></div>

<p>and who consorted with Dr. Barnes, the Austin Friar and friend of
Luther<a name='fna_1815' id='fna_1815' href='#f_1815'><small>[1815]</small></a>. His advocacy of the divorce rendered him very
unpopular<a name='fna_1816' id='fna_1816' href='#f_1816'><small>[1816]</small></a>, and perhaps after the fall and death of his old
protector, Wolsey, he felt his position less secure. In Dec. 1531, he came
to London, having ‘disposed of his stuff at Oxford,’ to ask leave to
return to Italy for his health. It was thought impolitic to let him go,
‘he being so secret in the King’s great matter as he has been,’ and means
were found to keep him in England<a name='fna_1817' id='fna_1817' href='#f_1817'><small>[1817]</small></a>.</p>

<p>Wolsey had already appointed him public reader in theology at Cardinal
College, in succession to Thomas Brynknell, at a yearly salary of 53<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i>, besides commons<a name='fna_1818' id='fna_1818' href='#f_1818'><small>[1818]</small></a>; and in 1532, Henry VIII. re-appointed him to
the chair of divinity<a name='fna_1819' id='fna_1819' href='#f_1819'><small>[1819]</small></a>. He was also divinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> lecturer in Magdalen
College. In Jan. 1533, he writes to Thomas Cromwell,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘I have performed the duties of reader bestowed on me by the King, and
for greater advantage I have added public lectures. I have received no
remuneration, for those who distribute the King’s gifts do so
arbitrarily. I have often asked in vain. Mr. Baxter retains the
profits of my benefice, and has not paid me the money due Michaelmas
last<a name='fna_1820' id='fna_1820' href='#f_1820'><small>[1820]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>This appeal was not fruitless: in June, 1533, Dr. Nicholas de Burgo
received £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> from Cromwell<a name='fna_1821' id='fna_1821' href='#f_1821'><small>[1821]</small></a>. In 1534 he was still at
Oxford, and acted as substitute for the Commissary in the Chancellor’s
Court<a name='fna_1822' id='fna_1822' href='#f_1822'><small>[1822]</small></a>. Next year he obtained permission to return to Italy. In Oct.
he wrote to Henry VIII, expressing a hope that he would be allowed to
retain his fellowship at Oxford (<i>locus collegii</i>), and his
benefice<a name='fna_1823' id='fna_1823' href='#f_1823'><small>[1823]</small></a>. In the same year he resigned the divinity lectureship at
Magdalen College<a name='fna_1824' id='fna_1824' href='#f_1824'><small>[1824]</small></a>. In July 1537 he again wrote to the King from
Italy, renewing his previous request; he was at present prevented by
trouble and illness from coming to England, but hoped to come next
month<a name='fna_1825' id='fna_1825' href='#f_1825'><small>[1825]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Thomas Kirkham</b> was admitted B.D. in 1523, after twelve years’ study<a name='fna_1826' id='fna_1826' href='#f_1826'><small>[1826]</small></a>.
In 1526 he supplicated ‘that four years’ study after the degree of
Bachelor’ might entitle him to incept. He became D.D. in July, 1527, his
composition being reduced to £4, ‘because he is very poor,’ and in
November he was dispensed from the greater part of his necessary regency
as warden of the Grey Friars at Doncaster<a name='fna_1827' id='fna_1827' href='#f_1827'><small>[1827]</small></a>. He continued to hold this
office till the Dissolution<a name='fna_1828' id='fna_1828' href='#f_1828'><small>[1828]</small></a>. He was, in Wood’s words,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘a very zealous man against the divorce of King Henry VIII from Queen
Katharine<a name='fna_1829' id='fna_1829' href='#f_1829'><small>[1829]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He seems to have obtained Church preferment immediately after the
Dissolution. In Feb., 1539, Thomas Kirkham was admitted to the rectory of
St. Mary’s, Colchester<a name='fna_1830' id='fna_1830' href='#f_1830'><small>[1830]</small></a>, and in 1548, to that of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> Martin’s,
Outwich: he resigned the latter living in 1553 or 1554<a name='fna_1831' id='fna_1831' href='#f_1831'><small>[1831]</small></a>. From these
dates it is clear that he had joined the Protestant party.</p>

<p><b>Richard Brinkley</b> (co. Cambridge), D.D. of Cambridge, and ‘Minister General
of the Order of Minors throughout all England,’ was incorporated D.D. of
Oxford on June 26, 1524<a name='fna_1832' id='fna_1832' href='#f_1832'><small>[1832]</small></a>. There is a discrepancy about the dates,
which seems to admit of no satisfactory explanation. A Minorite called
Peter Brikley was S.T.B. of Cambridge in 1524. ‘Brinkley frater minor’ was
admitted D.D. of Cambridge in 1527, when he paid £5 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> ‘pro non
convivando<a name='fna_1833' id='fna_1833' href='#f_1833'><small>[1833]</small></a>.’ He was buried at Cambridge<a name='fna_1834' id='fna_1834' href='#f_1834'><small>[1834]</small></a>.</p>

<p>An illuminated copy of the Gospels in Greek, now MS. Caius College 403,
was lent to him out of the Franciscan Library at Oxford, as the following
inscription on p. 1 testifies,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Iste liber est de con(ventu) fratrum minorum Oxonie omissus et
accommodatus fratri Ricardo Brynkeley Magistro.’</p></div>

<p>Another MS. in the Caius College Library (No. 348), containing the Psalter
in Greek, has this note (p. 113):</p>

for B.D. in Jan. or Feb. 1525/6, having studied ten years ‘here and at
Paris.’ He was admitted to oppose on June 13, and became B.D. on June 28.
In Jan. 1527/8, he obtained grace to incept after fourteen years of study.
He was licensed in Feb. 1529/30. In June he obtained a reduction of his
composition to £5 on the score of poverty, and a dispensation (in advance)
from his necessary regency, because he was warden of some house of
Minorites. He incepted in July, 1530<a name='fna_1837' id='fna_1837' href='#f_1837'><small>[1837]</small></a>. He was warden of Lynn at the
Dissolution<a name='fna_1838' id='fna_1838' href='#f_1838'><small>[1838]</small></a>. Like so many others, he seems to have gone with the
times; he held the living of Thorley, Herts., from 1545 to 1562; was
collated to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> rectory of Wiley, Essex, in 1547, to that of Hadham,
Herts, in 1548; and became Prebendary of St. Paul’s in 1554. He probably
died in 1562<a name='fna_1839' id='fna_1839' href='#f_1839'><small>[1839]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Thomas Knottis</b> was admitted B.D. in May, 1527. He may be the same as the
Thomas Knott who supplicated for B.A. in 1522; if so, he became a
Franciscan after that date<a name='fna_1840' id='fna_1840' href='#f_1840'><small>[1840]</small></a>.</p>

<p>His composition was reduced to £5, owing to his poverty (June 22, 1530).
He was dispensed from his necessary regency,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘because he was lecturing in some house of the Order of Friars Minors’
(June 28, 1530).</p></div>

<p>He incepted D.D. in July, 1530<a name='fna_1845' id='fna_1845' href='#f_1845'><small>[1845]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John Arture</b> kept a horse in Oxford in 1528<a name='fna_1846' id='fna_1846' href='#f_1846'><small>[1846]</small></a>. In May, 1533, he
supplicated for B.D., after fourteen years of study; he was to preach,
before Christmas, a sermon at St. Mary’s,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘another from the pulpit (<i>e suggestu</i>) of St. Paul’s London, and
another <i>e pulpito</i> at Westminster<a name='fna_1847' id='fna_1847' href='#f_1847'><small>[1847]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>In Dec. of the same year he sued Joanna Coper for libel: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> scandal
about him, and his doings ‘at the sign of Bear’ (May, 1534) have already
been noticed. Soon afterwards he was again in trouble, and had to give
bail for his appearance whenever he should be required to answer certain
charges, which are not specified in the register<a name='fna_1848' id='fna_1848' href='#f_1848'><small>[1848]</small></a>. About this time
(1534-5) he was appointed warden of the Grey Friars of Canterbury,
according to his own account, by the King, ‘against the heart of the
provincial<a name='fna_1849' id='fna_1849' href='#f_1849'><small>[1849]</small></a>.’ There was continual war between himself and the
brethren of the house. Each side accused the other of hostility to the
King. Arthur wrote that he kept the observance somewhat strict because the
friars rebelled against the King and held so stiffly to the Bishop of
Rome<a name='fna_1850' id='fna_1850' href='#f_1850'><small>[1850]</small></a>. On the other hand a brother whom Arthur had imprisoned brought
an accusation of disloyalty against him. This seems to have been founded
on a sermon which Arthur was said to have preached in the Church of Herne
on Passion Sunday, 1535<a name='fna_1851' id='fna_1851' href='#f_1851'><small>[1851]</small></a>, in which he ‘blamed these new books and new
preachers for misleading the people’ and discouraging fasts, prayers, and
pilgrimages, especially to the shrine of St. Thomas.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘And he said, if so be that St. Thomas were a devil in hell, if the
Church had canonized him, we ought to worship him, for you ought to
believe us prelates though we preach false.’</p></div>

<p>Further he did not pray for the King as head of the Church, nor for the
Queen. As the result of this charge, Arthur was thrown into prison by
Cromwell’s orders, and an Observant, ‘his mortal enemy,’ was made his
keeper, while another friar was appointed warden. Fearing to be starved,
Arthur escaped to France, and wrote letters from Dieppe to a servant of
Cromwell, and to Browne, the Provincial Prior of the Austin Friars,
praying for his own recall and urging the punishment of his enemies<a name='fna_1852' id='fna_1852' href='#f_1852'><small>[1852]</small></a>.
He appears to have returned, if the dates in the Calendars are correct,
and to have been again arrested on Aug. 21, 1537 at Cromwell’s command by
‘Cardemaker<a name='fna_1853' id='fna_1853' href='#f_1853'><small>[1853]</small></a>.’</p>

<p><b>John Baccheler</b> was vice-warden or sub-warden of Grey Friars in 1529 and in
1534. At the latter date he became one of the sureties for Friar Robert
Puller. In June, 1533, supplicated for B.D., after studying twelve years:
the grace was conceded on condition of his preaching at St. Mary’s and
Paul’s Cross, but it does not appear whether the friar took advantage of
it<a name='fna_1854' id='fna_1854' href='#f_1854'><small>[1854]</small></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span><b>Gregory Based</b>, or <b>Basset</b>, B.D., was at one time suspected of heretical
leanings and subjected to persecution.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘For in Bristol (writes Foxe, referring to John Hooker as his
authority) he lay in prison long, and was almost famished, for having
a book of Martin Luther, called his Questions, which he a long time
privily had studied, and for the teaching youth a certain
catechism<a name='fna_1855' id='fna_1855' href='#f_1855'><small>[1855]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He afterwards abjured, and, to prove his orthodoxy, took a prominent part
in the examination and condemnation of Thomas Benet, who was burned at
Exeter in 1533<a name='fna_1856' id='fna_1856' href='#f_1856'><small>[1856]</small></a>. On December 20, 1534 (?), he came forward as one of
the sureties of Friar Robert Puller, for a debt of 25<i>s.</i>, in the
Chancellor’s Court at Oxford<a name='fna_1857' id='fna_1857' href='#f_1857'><small>[1857]</small></a>. He was still alive in Mary’s reign,
and is mentioned by Foxe as ‘a rank papist,’ in connexion with the trial
of Prest’s wife, a half-witted woman, who was burned as a heretic at
Exeter in 1558<a name='fna_1858' id='fna_1858' href='#f_1858'><small>[1858]</small></a>. In 1561 a warrant was out for the arrest of ‘Friar
Gregory, alias Gregory Basset, a common mass-sayer,’ who was lying hid, it
was thought, in Herefordshire<a name='fna_1859' id='fna_1859' href='#f_1859'><small>[1859]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Robert Beste</b> was summoned before the Chancellor’s Court on September 30,
1530, to answer a charge of ‘incontinence and disturbance of the peace:’
he does not appear to have been convicted. He continued to reside at
Oxford during the next few years. In 1539 he became vicar of St. Martin’s
in the Fields; he supported the reformation, and was expelled from his
vicarage on Mary’s accession. He was afterwards reinstated, and resigned
the living before January, 1572<a name='fna_1860' id='fna_1860' href='#f_1860'><small>[1860]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Nicholas Sall</b>, admitted B.D. March, 1531/2<a name='fna_1861' id='fna_1861' href='#f_1861'><small>[1861]</small></a>.</p>

Oxford<a name='fna_1862' id='fna_1862' href='#f_1862'><small>[1862]</small></a>. In 1509, John Rickes, M.A. (who may have been the same
person), was elected fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge<a name='fna_1863' id='fna_1863' href='#f_1863'><small>[1863]</small></a>. In

reign he took refuge at Strasburg with John Jewell. In 1559 he obtained
the archdeaconry and a prebend of Gloucester, which he held till 1571 or
later. In 1576 he was instituted Vicar of St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch, and
died before June 14, 1577<a name='fna_1901' id='fna_1901' href='#f_1901'><small>[1901]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Anthony Brookby</b> (Brockbey, Brorbe), sometime student in Magdalen College,
a man learned in Greek and Hebrew, entered the Franciscan Order apparently
after leaving the University. Bourchier calls him licentiate in theology
at Oxford; Francis a S. Clara, Doctor of Theology. He attacked the King’s
anti-papal and anti-monastic measures, was thrown into prison, tortured,
and at length (July 19, 1537) strangled with his own cord<a name='fna_1902' id='fna_1902' href='#f_1902'><small>[1902]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John Forest</b>, who entered the Franciscan Order at Greenwich, about the age
of seventeen, is said by Wood to have been instructed afterwards in
theology among the Friars Minors of Oxford, and to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> supplicated for
B.D. There seems to be no evidence in support of this statement. Forest
was burnt in 1538, aged sixty-four, for denying the royal supremacy<a name='fna_1903' id='fna_1903' href='#f_1903'><small>[1903]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John Taylor</b> alias <b>Cardmaker</b>, of Exeter, entered the Franciscan Order when
under age<a name='fna_1904' id='fna_1904' href='#f_1904'><small>[1904]</small></a>. In Dec. 1532, after studying sixteen years at Oxford and
Cambridge, he obtained grace to proceed to B.D.<a name='fna_1905' id='fna_1905' href='#f_1905'><small>[1905]</small></a> He was warden of the
Grey Friars at Exeter in 1534<a name='fna_1906' id='fna_1906' href='#f_1906'><small>[1906]</small></a>. At the time of the Dissolution he
preached against the Pope<a name='fna_1907' id='fna_1907' href='#f_1907'><small>[1907]</small></a>. In 1543 he became vicar of St. Bride’s in
Fleet Street<a name='fna_1908' id='fna_1908' href='#f_1908'><small>[1908]</small></a>, then prebendary, and in 1547 Chancellor of
Wells<a name='fna_1909' id='fna_1909' href='#f_1909'><small>[1909]</small></a>. In the reign of Edward VI. he married a widow (by whom he had
a daughter)<a name='fna_1910' id='fna_1910' href='#f_1910'><small>[1910]</small></a>, and was appointed reader in St. Paul’s, where he
lectured three times a week<a name='fna_1911' id='fna_1911' href='#f_1911'><small>[1911]</small></a>;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘his lectures were so offensive to the Roman Catholic party, that they
abused him to his face, and with their knives would cut and haggle his
gown<a name='fna_1912' id='fna_1912' href='#f_1912'><small>[1912]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>On the accession of Mary he tried to escape to the continent, disguised as
a merchant; he was caught, committed to the Fleet, and afterwards removed
to the Compter in Bread Street<a name='fna_1913' id='fna_1913' href='#f_1913'><small>[1913]</small></a>. Convened before Gardiner and others,
he appears to have shown some signs of wavering at first.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘You shall right well perceive,’ he wrote to a friend, ‘that I am not
gone back, as some men do report me, but am as ready to give my life
as any of my brethren that are gone before me; although by a policy I
have a little prolonged it, ... That day that I recant any point of
doctrine, I shall suffer twenty kinds of death<a name='fna_1914' id='fna_1914' href='#f_1914'><small>[1914]</small></a>.’</p></div>

<p>He was convicted of heresy, deprived of his preferments, and burnt with
others at Smithfield on May 30, 1555<a name='fna_1915' id='fna_1915' href='#f_1915'><small>[1915]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John Crayford</b> or <b>Crawfurthe</b> supplicated for B.D. in April,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> 1537, after
studying fourteen years at Oxford and Cambridge<a name='fna_1916' id='fna_1916' href='#f_1916'><small>[1916]</small></a>. He was the last
warden of the Grey Friars at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and surrendered his house
to the King on Jan. 9, 1538/9<a name='fna_1917' id='fna_1917' href='#f_1917'><small>[1917]</small></a>. In 1543 he was presented by Henry
VIII to a canonry in Durham Cathedral. He became vicar of Midford in
Northumberland in 1546, and resigned the living in or before 1561. He died
in 1562, bequeathing legacies to several of the canons, grammar-scholars,
and others connected with the church of Durham. To the library he left St.
Augustine’s works in ten volumes, St. Basil in Greek and Latin, and Rabbi
Moses in print; and to Sir Stephen Holiday, all St. Cyprian’s works. He
willed his body to be buried in St. Michael’s, Wytton-Gylbert, if he died
there; otherwise in Durham Cathedral<a name='fna_1918' id='fna_1918' href='#f_1918'><small>[1918]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Hugh Glaseyere</b> supplicated in 1535 that fourteen years’ study might
suffice for his admission to oppose and read the <i>Sentences</i>. He was
admitted to oppose on July 13, and B.D. on July 14, 1538<a name='fna_1919' id='fna_1919' href='#f_1919'><small>[1919]</small></a>, i.e. on
the day of the dissolution of the Oxford friary. His name, however, does
not appear in the list of Minorites at Oxford ‘who would have their
capacities.’ He conformed to the various changes in religion. In November,
1538, he was instituted to the rectory of Hanworth, Middlesex, on the
presentation of the King; he resigned it in 1554. In 1546 he was appointed
to the rectory of Harlington, which he held till his death<a name='fna_1920' id='fna_1920' href='#f_1920'><small>[1920]</small></a>. In 1541
he was appointed by Cranmer to the difficult post of commissary-general of
the Archbishop at Calais<a name='fna_1921' id='fna_1921' href='#f_1921'><small>[1921]</small></a>. In 1542 he was made canon of Christchurch,
Canterbury<a name='fna_1922' id='fna_1922' href='#f_1922'><small>[1922]</small></a>. In Edward’s reign he was reckoned ‘an eager man for
reformation,’ and preached at Paul’s Cross (1547) that the observation of
Lent was only</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘a politic ordinance of man, and might therefore be broken of men at
their leisure’<a name='fna_1923' id='fna_1923' href='#f_1923'><small>[1923]</small></a>.</p></div>

<p>In 1553 he was presented by Queen Mary to the rectory of
Deal<a name='fna_1924' id='fna_1924' href='#f_1924'><small>[1924]</small></a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> In

suppression of heresy in his diocese, among them being Hugh Glazier,
S.T.B.<a name='fna_1925' id='fna_1925' href='#f_1925'><small>[1925]</small></a> Hugh did not survive the persecution in Kent which followed.
On the 27th July, 1558, ‘Magister Glasier, sacellanus cardinalis,’ was
buried at Lambeth<a name='fna_1926' id='fna_1926' href='#f_1926'><small>[1926]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Henry Stretsham</b> supplicated for B.D. in May, 1538, having studied twelve
years at Oxford and Cambridge; he was to preach at St. Mary’s and in some
other church <i>intra Universitatis precinctum</i><a name='fna_1927' id='fna_1927' href='#f_1927'><small>[1927]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Radulph Kyrswell</b>, or <b>Creswell</b>, was an Observant Friar at Reading in 1534,
having probably been sent there as a prisoner for refusing to acknowledge
the royal supremacy. At the time of the dissolution he was at Oxford, and
as priest supplicated for a ‘capacity’<a name='fna_1929' id='fna_1929' href='#f_1929'><small>[1929]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>Robert Newman</b> was one of the priests among the Oxford Franciscans at the
dissolution who asked for ‘capacities.’ He became vicar of Hampton in
1541, joined the reforming party, and was deprived of the living on the
accession of Mary<a name='fna_1930' id='fna_1930' href='#f_1930'><small>[1930]</small></a>.</p>

<p><b>John Comre</b> (?), <b>James Cantwell</b>, <b>Thomas Cappes</b>, <b>William Bowghnell</b>, <b>James

der Generalconstitutionen des Franziskaner-Ordens,’ in the ‘Archiv für

Franciscan School at Oxford evidently had at this time a greater
reputation and greater popularity than those at Cambridge and London. But
why the burden should be especially heavy during the long vacation is not
quite clear. Can the Mendicant Friars have been to any large extent
dependent on the alms of the secular scholars?</p>

<p>This document&mdash;the prosecution of the collector of alms by the Warden of
the Oxford Friars Minors for embezzlement&mdash;seems to be the only one of the
kind extant. As Twyne points out, we should naturally have expected the
suit to be tried by the Chancellor, not by the Mayor and Bailiffs of
Oxford<a name='fna_1950' id='fna_1950' href='#f_1950'><small>[1950]</small></a>. The original is no longer to be found in the City Archives,
and is probably irretrievably lost. Twyne’s reference is: ‘Ibid. (i.e.
Oxford City Archives) Husteng’ Oxon’ tent. ibid’ die D (<i>lunæ</i> crossed
out) proxim’ post festum Epiphaniæ Domini, a<sup>o</sup> Ed. 3<sup>i</sup> 14<sup>o</sup>.’ (Jan.
1340/1.)</p>

<p>Ricardus de Whitchford minor summonitus fuit ad respondendum fratri
Johanni Ochampton Guardiano ordinis fratrum Minorum Oxon’ de placito
computi, et unde idem Gardianus per fratrem Johannem de Hentham attornatum
suum queritur quod praedictus Ricardus iniuste non reddit computum de
tempore quo fuit receptor denariorum ipsius Gardiani, etc.: et ideo
iniuste, quia idem Gardianus dicit quod praedictus Ricardus die Lunae
proximo post festum Santi Michaelis anno regni regis praedicti 14<sup>o</sup> (i.e.
<span class="smcaplc">A. D.</span> 1340) recepit apud Oxoniam de denariis dicti Gardiani per manus
diversorum ad summam 60 solidorum et amplius, viz. per manus Ricardi
famuli Johannis de Couton j marc, per manus Thomae de Lundon xij<sup>s</sup>, etc.,
ad computum inde reddendum cum inde requisitus fuerit, etc.: unde idem
Gardianus saepius postea venisset ad praedictum Ricardum et ipsum rogasset
ut computum ei inde reddidisset, etc.; idem Ricardus computum inde reddere
recusavit et adhuc recusat, etc.: unde dicit quod deterioratus est et<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>

Ricardus venit et non potest dedicere receptionem praedictam et petit
Auditores, etc.: et sic per curiam dantur ei Auditores, viz. Ricardus Cary
et Johannes le Peyntour, etc.: et idem Ricardus postea computavit coram
praefatis Auditoribus de summis praedictis, et invenitur in arreragiis de

illustrating in some degree the actual manner of life of a Franciscan

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_C" id="APPENDIX_C"></a>APPENDIX C.</h2>
<p class="title">CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE FRIARS PREACHERS AND FRIARS MINORS AT OXFORD, A. D. 1269.</p>


<p>This curious treatise, here printed for the first time, is preserved in
Vol. 3119 (ff. 86-88) of the Phillipps MSS. at Thirlestaine House. The
MS., a folio with two columns on each page, is written in a clear upright
hand of the late 13th or early 14th century. The work, which appears to
have been unknown to Wood, is attributed by Bale and Pits to Eccleston,
probably merely because it is bound up with a copy of Eccleston’s
Chronicle: the MS. itself gives no clue as to the author, and the style
bears no close resemblance to that of Eccleston. It is clearly the work of
an Oxford Minorite who was an eyewitness of, and probably a participator
in, the events which he records. The treatise is interesting as affording
a glimpse from the inside into the life of the Oxford friars, and as
showing the shifts and quibbles to which the Franciscans were compelled to
have recourse in order to establish their claim to be professors of
‘perfect poverty.’</p>

ad crucem in pariete depictam juravit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
dicens: ‘In crucifixo juro quod vos recipitis;’ et adjecit: ‘Ergo non sum
magnus clericus nec homo magne litterature, et tamen constanter hoc
affirmo, et in presencia pape, si necesse fuerit, affirmabo.’ Et cum esset
pluries increpatus ut taceret, sepius idem replicans affirmabat. Hec in
presencia duorum predicatorum et trium Minorum quos supra memoravimus
facta sunt, ideo certam probacionem habent.</p>

<p>Post hec fratres Minores, hiis non obstantibus, caritatis obsequia
predictis predicatoribus exhibuerunt, et accepto caritatis indicio, versus
domum suam conduxerunt. Cumque starent in porta fratrum Minorum, frater
Alanus ait, qui solus ibi tunc aderat cum predicatoribus: ‘Ffrater
Salomon, rogo in lege fraterne caritatis, ut verbum istud offensionis et
scandali de cetero de ore tuo non procedat, quia plane tibi facio
constare, quod non recipimus peccuniam per nos nec per alios; nec de
professione nostra recipere possumus.’ Respondit frater Salomon: ‘Ex
verbis tuis sic arguo: vos de non recipiendo peccuniam votum fecistis; hec
est major; assumo&mdash;et recepistis; ac concludo; ergo vos estis in statu
dampnacionis.’ Ad hec frater Alanus respondit: ‘Majorem concedimus,
minorem negamus, quia simpliciter falsa est; et ideo non est mirum si
conclusio sit falsa.’ Hiis dictis recesserunt fratres. Ad hec non modicum
fratres turbati, tum propter imposicionem tum propter imponendi modum.
Habita ergo deliberacione diligenti, de consilio discretorum, missi sunt
duo de minoribus ad predicatores, rogantes humiliter errata corrigi et
delinquentem regulariter emendari. Post modicum temporis spacium, missi
sunt duo de predicatoribus ad minores pro pace reformanda, viz. frater
Vincencius le Sauvage et frater Robertus de novo Mercato; qui fratribus
minoribus in unum convocatis hoc inicium proposuerunt. ‘Ffratres nostri
petunt, quod vos doceatis fratrem Salomonem errasse et falsum vobis
imposuisse, et extunc fratres nostri manum correctionis apponent et
delinquentem juxta peccata regulariter emendabunt.’</p>

<p>Ex parte minorum fuit responsum sic: ‘Vos affirmatis nos peccuniam
recipere, et ideo partem affirmativam tenetis; nos negamus, et negativam
tenemus. Unde, si ad probacionem accedendum sit, vestrum est probare, non
nostrum; quia affirmative, non negative, incumbit probacio.’ Quo dicto
tacuerunt predicatores. Hec de substancia nuncii.</p>

<p>Extra ordinarie proposita fuerunt ista verba, dicente fratre Roberto de
novo Mercato: ‘Videtur sic posse persuaderi quod vos recipitis peccuniam
per interpositas personas ad minus. Pono quod aliquis moriatur et in
testamento suo unam summam peccunie vobis leget.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> Quero cujus sit illa
peccunia. Defuncti non est, quia nichil proprietatis in ea aut in re alia
defunctus habet aut habere potest; vivencium enim et non moriencium est
jus et proprietatem in rebus habere, et in eis dominium vendicare.
Executorum non est, constat. Ergo aut omnino nullius erit, aut vestra
erit.’</p>

<p>Ad hec frater Minor dupliciter respondit; primo per instanciam sic:
‘Ponatur quod illa peccunia legaretur alicui fabrice alicujus ecclesie;
quero, cujus esset illa peccunia. Non executorum, constat; et secundum te
non est defuncti. Sed qua racione non est defuncti? Si defunctus unde
defunctus nichil proprietatis in rebus habet, nec fabrice illius ecclesie
erit, ut videtur; cum non sit major racio a parte fabrice non viventis,
quam a parte defuncti non viventis, ut videtur. Non est ergo necessarium
dicere quod legatum semper transit in dominium legatarii. Et ideo peccunia
quamvis nobis legetur, non est necesse dicere quod sit nostra. Ad quod
accedit quod nunquam in dominium consensimus, et nobis invitis et
contradicentibus nullo modo in dominium nostrum transire potest: vero
ipsam tanquam nostram petere possimus aut debemus nullo jure. Ex quo patet
quod racio vestra non valet.’</p>

<p>Secundo fuit sic responsum, quod, secundum diffinicionem jurisperitorum,
peccunia legata in bonis annumeratur defuncti, quousque transierit in
dominium et proprietatem legatarii. ‘In jus autem nostrum aut dominium
nullo modo potest transire, nobis invitis et non consentientibus. Unde,
qualitercumque peccunia ab executoribus deponatur seu apud quemcumque pro
fratribus reponatur, quam diu manet inexpensa, semper in bonis defuncti
annumeratur, et possunt eam executores, auctoritate propria vel defuncti,
repetere quando volunt. Quomodo<a name='fna_1957' id='fna_1957' href='#f_1957'><small>[1957]</small></a> ergo dicetur nostra? nullo modo.’</p>

<p>Ad hec predicatores, ut suam contra minores sentenciam roborarent, plures
casus personales proposuerunt, in quibus asserebant fratres minores non
posse excusari quin peccuniam per se vel per alios recepissent. Ad hec
frater minor respondit, dicens quod hoc in nullo modo derogat communitati;
quia communitas religionis a principio tales transgressores punit et
parata est semper punire, ubicumque fuerint inventi. Item transgressio
talium nullo modo probare potest, quod fratres stent cum transgressione
sue professionis, sicut vero<a name='fna_1958' id='fna_1958' href='#f_1958'><small>[1958]</small></a> lapsus carnis aut contumax
inobediencia, si contingeret, quod absit, alicujus persone singularis.</p>

<p>Circa hanc ergo materiam verbis cessantibus, dictum est a parte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> Minorum:
‘Mirum est, cum tot sint status religiosorum et tot status secularium tam
in clero quam in populo, sicut cernimus, quare diligencius et curiosius
(in) statum nostrum quam aliorum exploratur, et omnibus aliis tacentibus
vos soli verba de statu nostro tintinatis<a name='fna_1959' id='fna_1959' href='#f_1959'><small>[1959]</small></a> (?) et de professione
discutitis.’ Respondit frater Vincencius le Sauvage, ‘Hec est,’ inquit,
‘racio. Veniunt ad nos diversi seculares et religiosi, comparacionem inter
statum et statum facientes, statum vestrum extollentes, et nostrum in hoc
deprimentes, quod nos peccuniam recipimus, vos autem non recipitis,
judicantes nos in hoc minus perfectos mundi contemptores. Nos modo in
declaracionem veritatis et status nostri exaltacionem, dicimus vos hoc
facere per interpositas personas quod nos facimus in propriis personis.’
Et cum inculcando quereretur a fratre Vincencio, quare in ista materia
haberent contra minores faciem sic obstinatam, respondit: ‘Quia nunquam
duos fratres minores in hoc articulo inveni consencientes.’ Cui cum esset
responsum ex parte minorum; ‘En octo sumus congregati omnes unanimes et
uno corde et ore idem sencientes et asserentes;’ respondit, ‘Certe verum
est, sed si seorsum vos haberem in privata collacione, non ita esset;
eciam vos duos,’ demonstratis fratribus Willelmo de Wykham et Dyonisio,
‘habita seorsum collacione, invenirem discordes et de vobis diversa
elicerem.’ Ista turbato animo et impetu sponte<a name='fna_1960' id='fna_1960' href='#f_1960'><small>[1960]</small></a> (?) proferens, non
minus fratri suo proprio quam eciam ipsis fratribus minoribus offensionis
materiam dedit. Quod cum averteret, ad pedes fratrum se projecit in
terram, culpam confitendo. Cui frater suus proprius, verba contumeliosa
equanimiter non ferens, sic ait: ‘Cum mihi capud fregeris, penam<a name='fna_1961' id='fna_1961' href='#f_1961'><small>[1961]</small></a>
dabis.’ Quo dicto domum redierunt fratres.</p>

<p>Hic transeo unum diem in quo miserunt fratres minores ad predicatores
iterum postulantes sibi satisfieri, et errata regulariter corrigi; quibus
erat pacifice et mansuete responsum a parte predicatorum et de emenda
humiliter facienda promissum. Set in solucione promissi inventi sunt minus
habentes, unde tantum<a name='fna_1962' id='fna_1962' href='#f_1962'><small>[1962]</small></a> facta fuit negocii dilacio.</p>

<p>Cum vero pendente tempore predicatores juxta promissa nichil facerent,
minores injuriam personalem non multum ponderantes, sed injuriam
communitatis sue conniventibus oculis dissimulare non poterant, et ideo de
consilio discretorum miserunt ad predicatores iterum, duo postulantes.
Primum est, quod principalis transgressio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> facta per fratrem Salomonem
emendaretur; secundum est, quod fratres pacifici et mansueti ex parte
eorum ad tractandum de negocio pacis et amoris mitterentur. Quo petito,
habita deliberacione, missi sunt quatuor predicatores ad minores, quorum
principalis fuit frater Willelmus de Stargil. Qui, convocatis minoribus,
hoc nuncium ex parte fratrum suorum proposuerunt: ‘Ffrater Vincencius, qui
insolenter apud vos se habuit in nuncio faciendo, fuit in nostro capitulo
a proprio socio fratre Roberto de novo mercato accusatus, a suo superiore
correptus, et secundum exigenciam sue religionis punitus.’ Quo dicto,
siluit: et cum expectarent minores de principali responsum, sc. de facto
fratris Salomonis, nihil est auditum. Et cum peterent responsum sibi dari
de principali, responsum istud secundarium non multum ponderantes,
respondit frater Willelmus de Stargil predicator pro se et suis sociis, se
non esse ad hoc missos. Hec de substancia nuncii.</p>

<p>Extra ordinarie autem proposita ista verba fuerunt, dicente fratre Thoma
de Docking: ‘Mirum est, quod vos non cessatis nos impugnare in articulo de
recepcione peccunie, et hac racione, vos dicitis quod nos recipimus per
interpositam personam; nos e contra (?) negamus et dicimus quod non. Mota
est ergo lis et controversia inter nos et vos, et ideo oportuit per
judicem determinari, quia per nos non potuit. Demigravimus ad judicem non
quemcumque sed summum pontificem, et ad illum qui regulam nostram dictavit
et mentem beati francisci, eodem papa sibi ipsi testante, novit. Ipse pro
nobis sentenciavit. Quid ultra queritis? quid impugnatis?’ Et adjecit idem
frater Thomas de Docking, dicens: ‘Occurrit racio idem dictans, talis
peccunia a quocumque data seu quocumque titulo pro fratribus apud
quemcumque deposita nunquam est nostra; ergo nunquam recepimus eam nec per
nos nec per interpositam personam.’</p>

<p>Ad hoc respondit frater W. de Stargil, predicator, dicens: ‘Sic possem
arguere de capa quam porto que nunquam fuit mea, nec erit nec est; et
tamen ego recepi eam.’ Ad hoc obvium fuit instanciam non valere; Sic,
‘quamvis tu non habeas personalem proprietatem in capa tua, ordo tamen
tuus totus et communitas ordinis tui in ea proprietatem habet; sed nec
persona nec communitas ordinis nostri aliquam proprietatem habet nec
habere potest in peccunia a quocumque oblata, data, seu deposita. Preterea
in assercione vestra hoc inconveniens incurritis. Nos habemus regulam qua
utimur secundum declaracionem domini pape qui eam juxta mentem beati
francisci declaravit. In sua declaracione dicit, quod nos ipsam
declaracionem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> cum regula observando peccuniam non recipimus per
interpositam personam. Vos ergo, si insistitis contrarium asserendo, notam
mendacii, ut videtur, domino pape inponitis.’ Respondit frater predicator:
‘Absit a nobis hec presumpcio, sed plane videtur quod dominus papa non
declaravit regulam juxta mentem beati francisci et ipsius regule.’ Ad hec
frater Thomas de Docking sic opposuit: ‘Papa in sua declaracione dicit
quod intencionem beati francisci plenius novit, et ad hoc persuadendum
idem papa in sua declaracione tres raciones posuit: prima, quia longam
familiaritatem cum eo traxit, in qua solent homines secreta cordium suorum
mutuo communicare; secunda, quia in condendo predictam regulam sibi
astitit cum esset in minori officio constitutus; tercia, quia in optinendo
ipsius regule confirmacionem eciam sibi non defuit. Si ergo papa dicit et
racionibus convincit, se nosse intencionem beati francisci, ex quo eciam
sequitur declaracionem factam juxta intencionem ejusdem sancti, quid
dicetis?’</p>

<p>Ad hoc quidam predicator dixit: ‘Nullo modo videtur quod papa novit
intencionem beati francisci, quod probo sic. Voluntas testamentaria fuit
beati francisci, quod fratres nullo modo quererent litteras expositorias a
sede apostolica, sed hoc non obstante quesierunt et papa annuente
optinuerunt. Non solum ergo fratres sed et papa contra intencionem ejus
fecerunt; ex quo videtur quod intencionem ejus non noverunt; quia si ipsam
novissent contra ipsam non fecissent.’</p>

<p>Ad hoc frater Minor: ‘Esto quod racio sit bona, cum illacio sit satis
mirabilis. Ex hac racione probatur papam vel mentitum esse vel falsum
dixisse; ipse enim dixit, plenius novimus intencionem ipsius sancti.
Preterea, ut ad unum sit dicere de testamento suo quod non novimus, non
respondemus, sed regulam quam observare promisimus parati sumus defendere.
Accedit ad hoc, quod nec fratres nec dominus papa fecerunt contra
intencionem beati francisci, quam in condendo regulam habuit, sed contra
intencionem petende declaracionis. Nec in hoc pape potuit in aliquo
prejudicari in facienda declaracione, maxime cum apud eum resideat plena
potestas et auctoritas tocius ecclesie gubernande. Quo etiam in sua
declaracione dicente et probante, ut patet inspicienti, hoc non potest nec
debet in aliquo fratribus prejudicari.’</p>

<p>Inter hec et alia que proponebantur, ait frater W. de Stargil: ‘Scimus
quidem quia regulam et regule declaracionem ab eo qui potuit declarare,
habetis et utramque observatis; hoc et nobiscum confitemur. Sed quomodo
vos peccuniam non recipiatis, non <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>videmus.’ Ad hoc ffrater Thomas Docking
sic respondit: ‘Frater karissime, audeo plane dicere, quod si habitum
secularem haberes quem ante habitum tue religionis portabas, facillime
veritatem mee professionis tibi persuaderem; et ad spacium vii psalmorum
quam nos videmus luce ipse clarius videres.’</p>

<p>Hiis ergo transactis transivimus ad principale, petentes iterum quod ipsi
responderent nobis de principali, ipsum accessorium de quo factum est
nuncium non ponderantes. Respondit frater W. sicut prius, dicens se non
posse nec debere hoc facere, cum non esset ad hoc missus; tamen peticionem
nostram libenter fratribus suis nunciaret. Quo facto domum redierunt
fratres.</p>

<p>Hic transeo alium diem, in quo missi sunt de minoribus duo ad
predicatores, quibus facte fuerunt multe promissiones de correctione
facienda, sed in solvendo promissum inventi sunt iterum minus habentes, ut
videtur: unde tantum fuit dilacio negocii. Interim pendente tempore et
fratribus predicatoribus nichil respondentibus, supervenit prior
provincialis predicatorum<a name='fna_1963' id='fna_1963' href='#f_1963'><small>[1963]</small></a> Oxoniam. Ffratres Minores pro pace mutua
reconsilianda<a name='fna_1964' id='fna_1964' href='#f_1964'><small>[1964]</small></a> et servanda miserunt<a name='fna_1965' id='fna_1965' href='#f_1965'><small>[1965]</small></a> ad eum, cum humilitate
postulantes, excessum corrigi et sibi regulariter satisfieri. Prior vero
provincialis, habita deliberacione et facta diligenti inquisicione per
fratres suos, sic respondit: ‘Ego claudam os fratris de cetero ne presumat
talia dicere contra vos, et ego ipse dicam sicut vos ipsi, cum de illo
articulo agitur, dicitis; et ut alii fratres sic dicant, pro viribus
inducam. Fratrem vero Salomonem, quem vos esse transgressum (dicitis),
aliter punire non possum, quia plane sicut dixit ita et sentit, nec induci
potest ad contrarium, quia sua consciencia est quod vos estis receptores
peccuniarum ad minus per interpositas personas; unde ego contra leges
consciencie non possum. Misissem autem ipsum pro culpa dicenda sua ad vos,
sed timui ne ipse plus vos provocasset et fierent novissima pejora
prioribus.’ Hic nota quod frater non dixit ex surrepcione, sed ex plena
deliberacione. Hec de substancia nuncii.</p>

<p>Extra ordinarie autem allocutus priorem predicatorum quidam de minoribus
cum mansuetudine predicatoris<a name='fna_1966' id='fna_1966' href='#f_1966'><small>[1966]</small></a> et obsecrans, ut ipse partes suas de
pace lesa reparanda et reparata jam fovenda vigilanter juxta discrecionem
a deo sibi datam interponeret. Adjecit autem dictus frater minor cum
mansuetudine dicens: ‘Mirum est quod ita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> extranee de re nobis manifesta
quidam de vestris senciunt, maxime cum peccunia a quocumque legata seu
donata nunquam ad dominium nostrum transeat. Et propterea nullo modo dici
possumus receptores non per nos nec per interpositas personas.’ Respondit
prior provincialis cum mansuetudine dicens: ‘Unum est quod videre non
possumus. Cum peccunia in usus vestros quocumque titulo deputata
multociens sit apud multos deposita, et cum post deposicionem transeat a
dominio conferentis nec cedat in dominium depositarii&mdash;hoc, inquam, est
quod videre non possumus, quin peccunia illa in vestrum cedat dominium.’</p>

<p>Ad hoc respondit frater minor, quod peccunia, quocumque titulo ad usus
fratrum deputata, nunquam in eorum dominium transeat juxta declaracionem
domini pape, sed possunt fratres in suis necessitatibus recursum habere ad
recipientem, qui auctoritate domini principalis potest fratribus, si vult
et non aliter, subvenire; quia jure debiti nullo modo fratribus tenetur,
nec nomine depositi aliquid<a name='fna_1967' id='fna_1967' href='#f_1967'><small>[1967]</small></a> exigere possunt ab eodem. Auctoritas
ergo et dominium peccunie quocumque titulo tradite permanet penes ipsum
tradentem, intantum quod nunquam transit nec transire potest in fratrum
dominium ullo jure: unde dicit<a name='fna_1968' id='fna_1968' href='#f_1968'><small>[1968]</small></a> dominus papa quod principalis potest
eam repetere si vult, quamdiu manet inexpensa.</p>

<p>Ad hoc prior: ‘Quid si peccunia penes ipsum recipientem est centum annis
aut plus remanserit?’ Ad hoc frater Minor: ‘Non plus juris habent fratres
nostri in peccunia in fine C annorum aut cujuscumque alterius spacii quam
in fine prime diei. Et hoc parati sumus probare, et pro loco et tempore
mundo manifestare.’</p>

<p>Ad hoc attonitus prior cum admiracione dixit: ‘Vere si hoc constaret,
mundo non sic habundaretis sicut habundatis.’ Respondit frater Minor:
‘Quomodocumque habundancia se habeat, veritatem professionis narro.’ Tunc
exclamans quidam predicator, cujus nomen ad presens ex causa retineo,
factum eorum ut videtur non approbans, ait: ‘Eya, domine deus, verba que
de vobis facimus ex malis que de nobis dicitis occasionem<a name='fna_1969' id='fna_1969' href='#f_1969'><small>[1969]</small></a> sumunt.’</p>

<p>Interim dum hec agebantur, fratres minores inter se contulerunt, et habito
consilio miserunt ad priorem provincialem gratias agentes de sua
oblacione, rogantes quod frater Salomon, ex quo conscienciam suam non
deponit nec culpam suam recognoscere proponit, pro mutua pace concilianda
et servanda, de loco, ex quo pacem perturbavit, amoveretur. Respondit
prior se super hoc velle deliberare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> Habita vero deliberacione,
sollempnes nuncios de ordine suo mittens, sic respondit: ‘Frater Salomon
pro conventu Oxon’ fratribus suis est multum necessarius et utilis sicut
bonus et ministerialis, in tantum eciam ut difficile esset mihi invenire
alium eis ita utilem et necessarium, et ideo grave esset ipsum amovere.
Item pro peccato privato, publica pena non debet adjungi. Hoc autem fieret
si frater Salomon de loco suo ad alium locum amoveretur. Unde peticio de
dicto fratre amovenda non videtur consona racioni. Nec debetis turbari,
quia peticionem vestram in hac parte non fulcio, quia, ut videtur, id quod
vobis primo optuli debet sufficere, viz. quod os ejus per obedienciam
claudatur, et ne de cetero a(liqua) sinistra contra puritatem regule
vestre dicere presumat.’</p>

<p>Ffacta ista responsione nuncii ex parte prioris tres faciebant peticiones.
Prima fuit, quod pro dicto unius stulti communitas fratrum minorum non
turbaretur; secunda fuit, quod caritas mutua ut olim omnimodis signis
ostenderetur. Tercia fuit quod regula nostra cum exposicione vel
exposicionibus eis ad tempus ostenderetur, ab illis tantummodo et non ab
aliis quam nos nominare decrevimus inspicienda. Hec de substancia nuncii.</p>

<p>Extra ordinarie autem facta sunt verba ista, dicente fratre Minore: ‘Si
stultus de sua stulticia corrigendus est, mirum est quod fratrem Salomonem
non corrigitis, qui in sua stulticia manet; quem eciam vos ipsi stultum
nominatis, cum petitis quod propter dictum unius stulti communitas fratrum
minorum non turbetur. Item si peccatum est corrigendum, maxime vobis qui
estis professores veritatis, mirum est quod fratrem Salomonem non
corrigitis, quem peccasse probatis, cum pro eo allegatis quod pro peccato
privato publica pena non sit injungenda.’</p>

<p>Post hec fratres Minores, habita diligenti deliberacione, perpendentes
quod fratres predicatores a principio in toto processu aut id negocium
distulerunt aut dissimulaverunt aut a principali diverterunt, ut videtur,
miserunt ad eos fratres diffinitive sic respondentes; ‘Pendente
principali, videtur fratribus quod peticionibus vestris accessoriis non
sit respondendum; unde ad huc petunt fratres quod frater Salomon, qui
pacem mutuam turbavit, ammoveatur; ad quod movere<a name='fna_1970' id='fna_1970' href='#f_1970'><small>[1970]</small></a> potest pax et
tranquillitas mutua utriusque ordinis, que est magis ponderanda quam
utilitas ministerialis unius persone. Ad hoc autem quod vos dicitis, quod
penitencia publica peccato privato non sit imponenda, sic responderunt
fratres; quod quamvis ammoveatur, peccatum suum non<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> publicatur. Est enim
pene omnium sentencia una, tam secularium quam religiosorum, quod fratres
vestri<a name='fna_1971' id='fna_1971' href='#f_1971'><small>[1971]</small></a> conventuales ad prelacias et ceteras dignitates, et studentes
ad doctorum officia exercenda, cum gloria et non cum ignominia, frequenter
emittuntur et de loco ad locum transferuntur. Unde ad huc petunt vel quod
ammoveatur vel quod culpam suam confiteatur. Et ad hoc movere debet, quod
fratres Minores in consimili casu personas multum dissimiles, viz.
lectores, in tantum humiliaverunt, quod pro levi occasione unum valde
graciosum ad pacem vestram conservandam de conventu suo ammoverunt, et
alium suspenderunt per annum a predicacione et confessione; et usque hodie
manet a lectione suspensus. Ad hoc autem quod vos dicitis, quod nobis
debet sufficere, quod os ejus obstruatur, ne mala de nobis loquatur,
respondent fratres, quod non debet sufficere, quia ad hoc tenetur de
communi lege caritatis eciam si nunquam aliquem offendisset.’ Cum vero
fratres non solum bis aut ter, sed eciam sepcies, pro correctione
transgressionis postulanda missi fuerunt, nec est eis in aliquo
satisfactum, dicunt quod nolunt ulterius vexari, sed si predicatores
noluerint hac vice satisfacere, sedebunt in domo patiencie sue,
expectantes tempora meliora. Hec de substancia nuncii.</p>

<p>Extra ordinarie autem fuit responsum a parte predicatorum ad racionem de
ammocione facienda sic: ‘Ffratris minorum delictum contra predicatores
fuit publicum, et ideo non fuit mirum si publice ammoveretur; sed istius
fratris predicatoris peccatum fuit privatum, et ideo non est simile.’ Ad
hoc frater Minor: ‘Esto quod illius fratris ammocio, cum esset persona
valde gravis, in cujus comparacione, secundum judicium humane
estimacionis, frater Salomon est persona multum humilis, movere non
debeat; saltem moveat vos quod alius lector fuit ammotus a loco suo pro
pace vestra servanda, qui eciam cum se in presencia quorundam predicatorum
excusaverat, nichil contra eum habuerunt nec habere potuerunt.’</p>

<p>Post hec, pendente dissencionis tempore et predicatoribus nihil super
petita respondentibus, urgente quadam necessitate, prior provincialis
predicatorum repente de Oxonia recessit; qui nacta temporis opportunitate
rediit, ne (?) incepta feliciter consummaret. Quadam vero die, clam
fratribus Minoribus, credentes fratres predicatores negocium<a name='fna_1972' id='fna_1972' href='#f_1972'><small>[1972]</small></a> melius
agere per seculares magistros, necnon et dissencionem et ejus occasionem
celerius quam per semet ipsos extirpare, rogatus est dominus Cancellarius
cum magistris quatuor de sollempnioribus tocius universitatis, ex parte
predicatorum in causa dissencionis fortiter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> instructi, subito et occulte
venerunt, et fratres Minores convocari rogaverunt, antequam de responsione
facienda aliquid deliberarent aut deliberare potuerunt<a name='fna_1973' id='fna_1973' href='#f_1973'><small>[1973]</small></a>. Convocatis
igitur minoribus, ex parte predicatorum, processum dissensionis supra
memoratum quamquam incomplete recitaverunt, hoc nuncium adicientes:
‘Petunt fratres predicatores et nos cum ipsis petimus, consilium in id
ipsum dantes, quod vos descendatis in formam pacis et unitatis. Ipsi enim
parati sunt, vobis, juxta racionis exigenciam et discrecionem
arbitrancium, regulariter per omnia satisfacere<a name='fna_1974' id='fna_1974' href='#f_1974'><small>[1974]</small></a>.’ Inculcando vero
adjecerunt: ‘Nos invenimus predicatores ad omnia secundum racionis
exigenciam paratissimos, iniantes quantum possunt forme pacis et unitatis
et fraterne caritatis; utinam in vobis contrarium non inveniamus.’ Hec de
substantia nuncii et consilii.</p>

<p>Ffacta autem ista peticione, deliberans penes se sicut potuit, quidam
frater Minor sic ait: ‘Magistri mei et amici karissimi, duo verba tantum
ad presens vobis propono, unum pro devota gratiarum accione, aliud pro
humili peticione. Primo enim regracior vobis pro labore vestro, quod vos
pro nobis pauperibus dignati estis tantum laborare, non minores gratiarum
acciones exsolvens, quam zelum dei habentes pro forma pacis et unitatis
insudatis. Secundo peto quod, sicut hodie principaliter pro predicatoribus
laborastis, secundario pro nobis, ita cras placeat vobis laborare
principaliter pro nobis, secundario pro predicatoribus, ut, vobis in unum
ubicumque placuerit convenientibus, super petita cum deliberacione
respondeam, et totum processum plenius manifestem.’ Magistri vero
instabant ut statim eis responderetur, si fieri posset bono modo. Minores
vero ad eorum instanciam ab eis paululum divertentes, habita
deliberacione, responderunt communiter ad omnia que magistri ex parte
predicatorum recitaverunt, in qua nimirum responsione non declinabant in
aliquo a responsionibus supra memoratis; adicientes quod, sicut
predicatores, ita et semet ipsos, ad formam pacis et unitatis paratos
invenirent. Hec de responsionis substancia.</p>

<p>Extra ordinarie autem facta fuerunt verba disputacionis magne inter
seculares magistros, fratribus minoribus nichil opponentibus aut
respondentibus; ubi fratres perpenderunt quod fuerunt contra eos graviter
informati. Ipsi vero habili cautela redimentes tempus pertraxerunt in
longum. Unde, pendente tempore, accidit quod bedellus universitatis missus
fuit eciam bis ex parte universitatis, dominum Cancellarium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> pro quadam
incepcione advocare; quo vocato una cum magistris aliis recessit.
Magistrorum nomina, qui cum ipso ex parte predicatorum venerant, erant
hec: Magister Johannes de Wyntun’, Magister Hugo de Corbrug’, Magister
Hugo de Hevesham, Magister Willelmus<a name='fna_1975' id='fna_1975' href='#f_1975'><small>[1975]</small></a> Pomay. Nomen vero Cancellarii,
Magister N. de Ewelm’.</p>

<p>Interim pendente tempore, minores quesierunt consilium, quid facto opus
esset discucientes. Ffacta vero discussione in hoc consenserunt, quod
amicos eorum, de quibus specialiter confiderant, convocarent, et eos
secundum veritatem de toto processu informarent. Convocatis autem quinque
de majoribus tocius universitatis, frater unus capitulum regule sue de
recepcione peccunie, et ejusdem declaracionem secundum dominum papam
factam, recitavit. Quesivit frater si magistri intelligerent. Respondit
Magister, persona multum sollempnis, in utroque jure peritus, Johannes le
Gras nomine: ‘Intelligo quidem ego.’ Et incepit volvere capitulum et
revolvere, et super hoc sermonem continuare. Qui ita proprie vitam fratrum
communem et vivendi modum quem tenebant, et secura consciencia tenere
poterant, instinctu nescio quo descripsit, quasi ipse inter fratres vitam
fratrum per longa tempora duxisset. Admiratus quidam frater quod ita
proprie loquebatur, quesivit an super hoc ab aliquo fratre fuisset
informatus. Magister respondit et cum juramento asseruit, se nunquam
verbum super hoc a fratre Minore prius audisse, adiciens hec verba:
‘Ponamus quod papa nunquam declarasset capitulum id, eciam secundum jura
communia possetis regulam vestram sancte et sincere observare. Nec dico
vobis aliud quam jura civilia et canonica communiter dicunt. Unde mirabile
est, quod vobis imponitur recepcio peccunie ad utilitatem vestram
quocumque titulo deputate, ex quo in dominium vestrum non transit nec
transire potest ullo jure, sed semper remanet dominium et auctoritas
peccunie penes principalem dominum, et eam repetere potest quando volt
quamdiu manet inexpensa.’ Et inculcando adjecit dicens: ‘Fratres, non
oportet ut in hoc casu timeatis. Ego enim sum paratus pro ista veritate
defensanda curiam adire romanam, si necesse esset, et aliquis se opponeret
impudenter.’ Magister Adam de Norfolk’ hoc idem sentit et idem dixit. Alii
vero facta super hoc longa disputacione idem senserunt.</p>

<p>Post hec ffrater unus totum processum a principio supra memoratum eis
enarravit. Quo audito obstipuerunt. Magistrorum vero nomina qui ex parte
minorum venerant hec fuerunt; Magister Johannes de Maydeston,
Archidiaconus Bedeford’, Magister Thomas de Bek’,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> Magister Johannes le
Gras, Magister Stephanus de Wytun’, Magister Adam de Norfolk’.</p>

<p>Post hec de istorum magistrorum consilio, rogaverunt minores magistros,
qui ex parte predicatorum venerant, ut iterum plenius veritatem audituri
convenirent. Qui cum venissent, et in uno loco cum magistris, qui ex parte
minorum venerant, congregati essent, unus minorum sic exorsus est, dicens:
‘Magistri boni, sicut scitis, ex infirmitate condicionis humane orta fuit
quedam dissensio, persuadente generis humani inimico, inter predicatores
et nos; et<a name='fna_1976' id='fna_1976' href='#f_1976'><small>[1976]</small></a> injuria incepit a predicatoribus; petimus nos bis
regulariter satisfieri. Oblata fuit quedam satisfactio, sed non sufficiens
nec plena, ut videbatur; et cum Minores amplius habere non poterant,
pacienter meliora tempora expectabant. Negocium autem id publicare eciam
amicis suis nolebant duplici racione; primo quia timebant animos
infirmorum scandalizare, secundo quia injuria a predicatoribus incepit et
absque correccione a suis superioribus dissimulata fuit, cum esset
correccio pluries petita; et ideo non poterant minores, ut videtur, hiis
et aliis causis, negocium istud publicare, nisi aliqua<a name='fna_1977' id='fna_1977' href='#f_1977'><small>[1977]</small></a> verba
dicerent que in predicatorum derogacionem sonarent, unde minus in
conspectu secularium commendabiles redderentur. Igitur contra infirmorum
scandala et contra predicatorum derogacionem sanctam cautelam adhibentes
prudenter tacuerunt et humiliter dissimulaverunt. Modo autem quia
predicatores primo amicis suis divulgaverunt, urgente quadam necessitate,
eciam minores suis amicis publicare voluerunt.’</p>

<p>Quo dicto, incepit idem frater omnes in communi informare sicut prius
specialiter Minorum amicos informabat. Quo facto ceperunt Magistri, qui
prius ex parte predicatorum venerant, aliqualiter magis pie quam prius
sentire. Facta igitur longa disputacione, de discretorum consilio facta
deliberacione, ait frater Minor: ‘Magistri karissimi, nos parati sumus per
omnia in hac causa stare arbitrio vestro et provisive discretioni in forma
pacis et unitatis, scientes quod nunquam sitivimus nec adhuc sitimus penam
fratris, sed tantum correccionem et emendam. Nec multum ponderamus fratris
emissionem de suo loco, sed omnis satisfaccio, quantacumque exilis, que
precludit viam et occasionem resumendi de cetero consimilia verba contra
nos, potest et debet nobis sufficere. Tamen, si placet, duas peticiones
vobis facio; primo, ut sic provideatis de forma pacis ut non detur<a name='fna_1978' id='fna_1978' href='#f_1978'><small>[1978]</small></a>
predicatoribus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> aut fratri, qui deliquit, occasio iterum delinquendi. Nec
hoc dico sine causa, quia si decreveritis ipsum non errasse nec
deliquisse, in futuro tempore, nacta aliquali occasione, posset dicere,
“sic et sic pro isto tempore dixi, toti universitati constabat, nec<a name='fna_1979' id='fna_1979' href='#f_1979'><small>[1979]</small></a>
judicabat me in aliquo deliquisse; quare eciam modo similiter non
dicerem?” Hec future dissensionis occasio piis cautelis est precludenda.
Secundo peto quod vos, ex quo vobis constat secundum jura, prout quidam
vestrum<a name='fna_1980' id='fna_1980' href='#f_1980'><small>[1980]</small></a> dicunt, quod frater ille est in errore consciencie, Priorem
suum provincialem adeatis et persuadeatis ei, quod ipse informet fratrem
suum ad conscienciam contrariam, ut videlicet errorem deponat, et pie,
sicut debet, de Minoribus senciat.’ Quod quidam se securos (?)
spoponderunt. Hec de substancia negocii.</p>

<p>Extra ordinarie autem allocutus est Gardianum in secreto unus de magistris
sollempnibus, Johannes le Gras nomine, sic dicens: ‘Ffrater karissime,
fratres vestri non deberent<a name='fna_1981' id='fna_1981' href='#f_1981'><small>[1981]</small></a> in aliquo turbari si fratres
predicatores de eis mala dixerint, quia pro constanti habeatis, quod quo
pejora de vobis dixerint, deterius eciam eis in hominum estimacione
eveniet, nec vobis cedet aut cedere potest in nocumentum, si tantum<a name='fna_1982' id='fna_1982' href='#f_1982'><small>[1982]</small></a>
claustra labiorum custodieritis et bona de ipsis semper predicaveritis.’</p>

<p>Cui Gardianus hec verba dixit: ‘Unum est de quo doleo et verecundor nimis,
et inde est quod fratres multum verecundantur; videlicet, quod istius
dissensionis noticia jam inter seculares est publicata, et que per nos
discuti poterat, per ipsos est discussa.’</p>

<p>Ad hoc Magister: ‘Nolite in hoc contristari aut verecundiam pati, sed
magis gaudere et diem letum ducite, et hac racione; Modo manifesta est
nobis omnibus veritas, que prius fuit occulta; unde nos, qui sumus majores
tocius universitatis, jam veraciter super facto isto informati, alios
informabimus. Sed et ego omni quo possum conatu omnes informare studebo,
et ipsos precipue predicatores conabor informare.’</p>

<p>Superveniens autem Magister alius, Hugo de Evesham nomine, hoc exaggerando
inculcavit, dicens: ‘Crede mihi, ffrater Gardiane, quod nos quinque
magistri, qui prius ex parte predicatorum venimus ad vos, eramus omnes
heri in presencia predicatorum constituti, ubi eciam prior ipse
provincialis non defuit; nec memini me unquam in vita mea forciorem
disputacionem audivisse, opponentibus nobis pro facto vestro secundum
diffinicionem utriusque juris et exigenciam racionis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> predicatoribus
communiter respondentibus; facta vero longa disputacione, ita predicatores
omnes racionibus vexavimus et convicimus, quod sedentes omnes in pace et
obstupescentes tacuerunt, in tantum quod prior ipse provincialis, inter
alios plus motus et spiritu sancto plenius, ut arbitror, informatus,
dixit: “Eya, dilectissimi Magistri, quid plura? quid ulterius inculcatis?
Ecce ego paratus sum discalciatis pedibus Minores, si vultis, adire et eis
per omnia satisfacere.”’ Adjecit autem Magister Hugo Corbrug’
occasionaliter hec verba in predicatorum presencia dicens, ‘Karissimi,
audeo plane dicere, quod ille qui dicit eos recipere peccuniam per se vel
per interpositam personam, qui declaracionem domini pape super regulam
fratrum Minorum observaverit (<i>sic</i>), audeo inquam plane dicere, quod nec
jura novit nec terminos juris.’ Alias autem in predicatorum eorundem
absencia dixerunt Magistri Johannes le Gras et Adam de Norfolch’; ‘Eciam
si papa nunquam regulam declarasset, possent eam fratres absque
prevaricacione observare, maxime cum peccunia ad eorum utilitatem
quocumque titulo deputata nunquam in dominium eorundem transeat<a name='fna_1983' id='fna_1983' href='#f_1983'><small>[1983]</small></a>
ipsis invitis.’ Et cum supplicaret Gardianus Magistro Stephano de Witon’
quod propter deum fratres predicatores secretius juxta scita legum
informaret, zelo accensus magister A. de Norf’ dixit: ‘Mirum est quid ipsi
habent intromittere se de professione vestra, et de regula vestra verba
tintinare, cum nec sunt superiores vestri, nec in aliquo spectat ad eos
vos corrigere, si, quod absit, contingeret vos in aliquo contra
professionem vestram aliquid attemptare. Quod autem petitis de
informacione facienda juxta scita legum, non est necesse sic petere; sed
petas ut juxta veritatem vestram informentur, omni eciam jure consopito.’
Et adjecit Magister Stephanus dicens: ‘Non solum paratus sum predicatores
pro vobis informare, sed eciam personaliter pro causa vestra curiam adire
romanam.’</p>

<p>Interim pendente tempore, iverunt Magistri quinque primo nominati, quorum
principalis fuit Cancellarius, ad predicatores, et efficaciter pro parte
minorum persuadentibus, tandem fratrem Salomonem, qui offensam fecerat, de
assensu et voluntate sui prioris provincialis necnon fratrum suorum, ad
fratres minores duxerunt, cum quo venerunt quinque<a name='fna_1984' id='fna_1984' href='#f_1984'><small>[1984]</small></a> fratres
predicatores subscripti; Adam de Lakeor, cum socio Willelmo de
Hodum’<a name='fna_1985' id='fna_1985' href='#f_1985'><small>[1985]</small></a>, eorum cursore de sentenciis, Radulphus de Swelm’, quondam
prior localis Oxon’, Iohannes de Mesley, tunc eorum visitator. Fuerunt
eciam cum predictis quinque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> Magistris, sex fratres minores subscripti;
Adam de Werministre, tunc Gardianus, Thomas de Doking, quondam lector
Oxon’, Willelmus de Heddel’, tunc lector Oxon’, Dyonisius, Robertus de
Cap(e)ll’, Alanus de Wakefend’. In quorum omnium conspectu pro bono pacis
frater Salomon hec verba nomine culpe in scriptis recitavit, et recitata
eciam in scriptis Gardiano tradidit; verba autem sunt hec: ‘Per illa verba
que protuli, non intellexi quod vos receperitis vel recipitis per vos vel
per alios peccuniam contra regulam vestram et ejus interpretacionem, nec
intendebam communitati vel ordini derogare. Et si ex modo dicendi fuistis
provocati, doleo, et peto quod remittatis.’ Hic finis negocii et
reformacio pacis, per omnia benedictus deus in secula amen.</p>

<p>Memorandum autem quod cum extra ordinarie facta essent verba inter
magistros seculares de veritate processus memorati, dixerunt inter
se<a name='fna_1986' id='fna_1986' href='#f_1986'><small>[1986]</small></a>, aliquid in processu propositum est falsum et calumpniabile, et
maxime quod pro fundamento erat positum. Ffrater N. predicator, nunquam se
fecisse illam racionem, ubi est conclusio de statu dampnacionis, manifeste
dicit, sed dicit fratrem Alanum minorem fecisse premissas. Ipse vero
subintulit; ‘Si ita est sicut vos dicitis, sequitur conclusio de statu
dampnacionis.’ Aliud autem calumpniabile non receperunt. Quod cum
minoribus constaret, vocatus fuit frater Alanus minor, in conspectu
Cancellarii et Magistri Johannis de Wynton’ requisitus super hoc, dixit:
‘Verum est, solus ego frater Minor eram in porta cum eis, et ideo
probacionem non habeo; sed tantum confido de veritate fratris Roberti de
Novo Mercato et ipsius eciam Salomonis, quod si ipsi requisiti dicant in
veritate deliberate consciencie, quod frater Salomon ipsam racionem non
fecit, ego libenter subiciam me pene, tanquam sufficienter essem de falsi
imposicione convictus.’ Post hec ait unus ffrater Minor: ‘De ista racione
magna vis non est, quia de racione cujus (?) non disputamus, sed de hoc
quod ipse nobis imposuit, quod negare non potuit, scilicet peccunie
recepcionem, emendam quesivimus et emendam, benedictus deus, recepimus.’
Terminata fuit ista dissensio Anno domini MCCLXIX Non’ Junii.</p>

<p><a name='f_1' id='f_1' href='#fna_1'>[1]</a> A few others have been used occasionally, such as the Phillipps
catalogue (1837), and Ulysse Robert’s <i>Inventaire sommaire</i>.</p>

<p><a name='f_2' id='f_2' href='#fna_2'>[2]</a> I have not seen Part 3 of Vol. 2 (Codices 15029-21405), which is
missing in the British Museum.</p>

<p><a name='f_3' id='f_3' href='#fna_3'>[3]</a> Chronicle of Thomas Eccleston, ‘De Adventu Minorum,’ Mon. Francisc. I,
p. 5: ‘<span class="smcaplc">A. D. MCCXXIV</span> ... feria tertia post festum nativitatis Beatae
Virginis.’ This date has been disputed. Wadding (Annales Minorum, I, 303,
362) places the arrival in 1219. The arguments in favour of this view are,
(1) that St. Francis appointed Agnellus minister of England in 1219; (2)
the statement of Matthew Paris <i>sub anno</i> 1243, that the friars ‘built
their first houses in England scarcely twenty-four years ago’ (Chron.
Majora, IV, 279). But the evidence in favour of (1) is not conclusive; the
letter of St. Francis to Agnellus (Wadding, I, 303; Collectanea
Anglo-Minoritica, pp. 5-6) is undated. The contention however seems to be
supported by a passage in Eccleston (Mon. Franc. I, 10), identifying the
32nd year after the settlement of the friars in England with the second
year of the ministry of Peter of Tewkesbury, who according to the received
chronology became minister in 1250 (more probably 1251). From this one
might conjecture that the establishment of the English province was
officially dated from 1219. But the fragment in Mon. Franc. II, and
another MS. of Eccleston in the Phillipps Library at Thirlestaine House,
No. 3119, fol. 71-80 (a MS. unknown to either of the editors of the
Monumenta Franciscana), read here (fol. 73) ‘<i>quinto anno administrationis
Fratris Petri</i>,’ instead of ‘<i>secundo anno</i>,’ and this is probably the
correct version. As to argument (2), Paris probably wrote his account (of
1243) a few years later than 1243, and dated accordingly; again the
passage refers to Dominicans as well as Franciscans. The evidence in
favour of the later date is much stronger. Besides Eccleston, the best
authority, we have the statement of the author of the Lanercost Chronicle,
himself a Friar Minor: ‘Quo et anno (1224) post festum natalis Virginis
gloriosae applicuerunt fratres Minorum in Angliam’ (p. 30). This may be
derived from Eccleston, but on the next page is a statement which is
certainly independent of him: ‘Eodem anno (1224) venerunt primo fratres
Minores in Angliam, in festo beati Bartholomaei apostoli’ (Aug. 24). Cf.
‘Annals of Worcester,’ <i>sub anno</i> 1224 (Ann. Monast. IV, 416).</p>

<p><a name='f_4' id='f_4' href='#fna_4'>[4]</a> If so, Bartholomew’s narrative is inaccurate; according to him the
adventure happened to Agnellus and his four companions (among whom was
Albert of Pisa) on their way from Canterbury to Oxford. But Bartholomew is
not remarkable for accuracy. Liber Conformitatum, fol. 79 (ed. Milan,
1510).</p>

<p><a name='f_5' id='f_5' href='#fna_5'>[5]</a> ‘Joculatores et non dei servos.’ Wood’s version of the story differs
in several points from that of Bartholomew of Pisa, from whom it is
professedly derived. (MS. F 29a, f. 175a, quoted in Dugdale, VI, pt. 3, p.
1524.)</p>

arrival of the Franciscans at Oxford in the year 1225, the hiring of their
first house in 1226, of their second ‘at the beginning of the thirties,’
on the authority of Eccleston.</p>

ordinary price for russet&mdash;i.e. undyed cloth of black wool&mdash;was 1<i>s.</i>

Fletcher, The Black Friars of Oxford, p. 6.</p>

<p><a name='f_271' id='f_271' href='#fna_271'>[271]</a> As the estimates of the numbers of friars and monks vary
considerably, it may be worth while to give the evidence (which is
entirely indirect) on which this calculation is based. In 1255, there
were, according to Eccleston, 49 Franciscan houses in England and 1242
friars, giving an average of rather more than 25 to each convent (Mon.
Franc. I, 10). At London, according to the <i>Regist. Fratrum Min. London.</i>,
there were about 100 friars, on the average, in the fourteenth century
(Ibid. p. 512). The public records give more trustworthy statistics. It
was often customary for the kings on their progresses to give pittances of
4<i>d.</i> each to the friars of the places through which they passed. I have
found no such grant to the Oxford Minorites: but the statement in the text
may be compared with the following instances.</p>

<p>At <i>London</i> in 1243, there were <i>80</i> Minorites (Liberate, 28 Hen. III, m.
18: cf. also Q. R. Wardrobe, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>6</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">3</span> and
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>8</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">1</span>); August, 1314, <i>64</i> (Q. R.
Wardrobe, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>24</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">10</span>); October, 1314, <i>72</i>
(Q. R. Wardrobe, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>24</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">10</span>); 1315, <i>72</i>
(Q. R. Wardrobe, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>24</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">10</span>); 1325, <i>72</i>
(Q. R. Wardrobe, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>25</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">1</span>). At <i>Norwich</i>
in 1326, <i>47</i> (Q. R. Wardrobe, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>25</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">1</span>).
At <i>Lynn</i> in 1326, <i>38</i> (Q. R. Wardrobe, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>25</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">1</span>).
At <i>Gloucester</i> in 1326, <i>40</i> (Q. R. Wardrobe, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>25</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">1</span>). At
<i>Cambridge</i> in 1326, <i>70</i> (Q. R. Wardrobe, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>25</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">1</span>).</p>

<p>It is not often possible to compare the numbers in the same houses at
different dates. In the northern convents, before the Black Death, there
was a large decrease: thus at <i>Newcastle</i> in 1299, provision was made for
<i>68</i> Minorites (Q. R. Wardrobe, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>8</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">55</span> f. 4); about 45 years later, for <i>32</i>
only (Chapter-house Books, A <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>5</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">10</span>, 149); but this may be explained by
reference to the special circumstances of the North. Elsewhere we find an
increase.</p>

<p>At <i>Winchester</i>, there were <i>23</i> Minorites in 1243 (Liberate, 27 Hen. III,
m. 2); <i>43</i> in 1315 (Q. R. Wardrobe, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>24</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">10</span>).
At <i>Reading</i>, there were <i>13</i> in 1239 (Liberate, 23 Hen. III, m. 3); <i>26</i> in 1326 (Q. R. Wardrobe,
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>15</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">1</span>).</p>

<p>From these figures, and from the Bull of Clement V in 1309 (granting
property of the Friars of the Sack to the Grey Friars), we may infer that
the numbers in the Oxford convent increased rather than diminished up to
<span class="smcaplc">A. D.</span> 1349.</p>

quoted at some length: ‘An excellent lecturer, who studied with me at
Oxford, used always in the schools, when the master was lecturing or
disputing, to employ himself in the compilation of original things instead
of attending to the lecture. Now when he had become lecturer himself, his
hearers became so inattentive, that he said he would as lief shut up his
book every day and go home, as lecture; and conscience-stricken he said,
“By a just judgment of God, no one will listen to me, because I would
never listen to any teacher.” He was besides, since he consorted too much
with seculars and thus paid less attention to the brethren than was usual,
a living example to the others, that the words of wisdom are only learnt
in silence and quiet.... But after he had returned to himself and applied
himself to quiet contemplation, he made such excellent progress that the
Bishop of Lincoln said that “he himself could not have delivered such a
lecture as he had delivered.” So, as his good fame grew, he was called to
the parts of Lombardy by the General Minister, and in the very court of
the pope was in high repute. But at last, as he was in the extreme agony,
the Mother of God, to whom he had always been devoted, appeared to him,
and drove away the evil spirits, and he was held worthy, as he afterwards
revealed to a friend, to enter happily to the pains of purgatory. For he
told him that he was in purgatory and had great pains in his feet, because
he was wont to go too often to a holy woman (<i>religiosam matronam</i>) to
console her, when he ought to have been intent on his lectures and other
more necessary occupations; he begged him also to have masses celebrated
for his soul.’</p>

<p><a name='f_498' id='f_498' href='#fna_498'>[498]</a> Dean Plumptre (Contemp. Rev. II, p. 376 note) identifies the
‘unnamed professor at Paris,’ referred to by Roger Bacon, with Thomas
Aquinas, and I am inclined to agree with this suggestion. A passage in
Royal MS. 7 F. VII. f. 159 (quoted in Part II, <i>sub</i> Richard of Cornwall)
would at first sight seem to identify the unnamed professor with Friar
Ric. of Cornwall. But there is no evidence that the latter was quoted as
an authority in the schools (like Aristotle, Avicenna, and Averroes)
during his lifetime (Bacon, Op. Ined. p. 30), nor could the statement that
‘he never heard lectures on philosophy and was not educated at Paris or
any other school where philosophy flourishes’ (ibid. 31 and 327) apply to
Richard (Mon. Franc. I, 39). On the other hand, all the facts mentioned
about the unnamed professor coincide with what is known of Thomas Aquinas
(Quétif-Echard, I, 271). It may then be assumed with some probability that
we have here Bacon’s judgment on his great contemporary. ‘Truly,’ he
writes, ‘I praise him more than all the crowd of students, because he is a
very studious man, and has seen infinite things, and had expense; and so
he has been able to collect much that is useful from the sea of authors,’
but he was fatally handicapped by not going through the regular training
(Opera Ined. p. 327). His followers maintain that philosophy as published
in his works is complete&mdash;that nothing further can be added. ‘These
writings,’ Bacon continues, ‘have four sins: the first is infinite puerile
vanity; the second is ineffable falsity; the third superfluity of
volume ...; the fourth is that parts of philosophy of magnificent utility
and immense beauty and without which facts of common knowledge (<i>quae
vulgata sunt</i>) cannot be understood&mdash;concerning which I write to your
glory&mdash;have been omitted by the author of these works. And therefore there
is no utility in those writings, but the greatest injury to wisdom.’</p>

<p><a name='f_539' id='f_539' href='#fna_539'>[539]</a> See the curious account in the <i>Continuatio Eulogii Historiarum</i> of
the council of bishops and lords held at Westminster under the presidency
of the Black Prince in 1374, the subject of discussion being the papal
tribute. Four doctors of theology were present, namely, the Provincial of
the Friars Preachers, J. Owtred, monk of Durham, an opponent of the friars
(see MS. Ball. Coll. 149, ff. 63-5), J. Mardisle, Friar Minor, and an
Austin Friar. The Archbishop said, ‘The pope is lord of all; we cannot
refuse him this,’ ‘quod omnes praelati seriatim dixerunt.’ The Dominican
refused to give an opinion, and suggested a hymn or mass. The monk used
the old argument about the two swords. Mardisle promptly retorted with the
text, ‘Put up again thy sword into his place,’ showing that the two swords
did not mean spiritual and temporal power; ‘et quod Christus temporale
dominium non habebat, nec Apostolis tradidit sed relinquere docuit;’ which
he proved by a learned appeal to scripture, authorities, and history. The
subsequent proceedings are very humorously told; Eulog. Hist. III, 337-8.
Four Mendicant B.D.’s were, at John of Gaunt’s wish, present at Wiclif’s
trial in 1377, to support him by argument in case of need. Lechler, I,

<p><a name='f_542' id='f_542' href='#fna_542'>[542]</a> These are clearly stated in his treatise ‘<i>De Blasphemia, contra
Fratres</i>,’ Select English Works, III, 402 seq.; Trialogus, Lib. IV, cap.
27-32. Ibid. cap. 37, another charge is added, namely, the opposition
offered by the friars to the ‘Poor Priests,’ of which Wiclif says: ‘Revera
inter omnia peccata, quae unquam consideravi de fratribus, hoc mihi
videtur esse sceleratissimum propter multa; emanavit enim integre ex
unicordi consilio et consensu omnium horum fratrum.’ The ‘Poor Priests’
resembled the early Friars Minors in many points, e.g. as itinerant
preachers: perhaps Wiclif, when organizing the former, was led to look
more closely into the ideal which the latter professed to follow; and if
so, he may well have been shocked at the contrast between that ideal and
the reality. One change in the life of the friars&mdash;their gradual
approximation to the seclusion of the older Orders, may be illustrated by
two passages from Matthew Paris and Wiclif (allowance being made for the
prejudices of the writers). The friars, says the Benedictine historian,
‘wandered through cities and villages,’ and ‘had the ocean for their
cloister’ (Chron. Majora, V, 529). Wiclif attacks them for living ‘closed
in a cloister,’ instead of going about among the people, ‘to whom thy maie
most profite ghostlie ... Charitie showld drive Friars to come out amongst
the people and leaue Caymes Castels that bin so needeless and chargeous to
the people.’ (Two Short Treatises, &amp;c., p. 21.)</p>

<p><a name='f_657' id='f_657' href='#fna_657'>[657]</a> Some of the wills are not complete, e.g. those of Phil. Kemerdyn
(1446), T. Cartwright (1532), and E. Standish (1533).</p>

<p><a name='f_658' id='f_658' href='#fna_658'>[658]</a> As the Hustings Court was only concerned with freehold property in
Oxford, it is rarely that the whole will is found in the Old White Book.
About thirty date from 1348-9, but I do not think that any one of them is
entire. Two Oxford wills of this date are among the ‘Early Lincoln Wills’
(p. 39), those of Ric. Cary and Alice his wife, but contain no bequests to
the friars. This is perhaps the Ric. Cary who granted land to the
Franciscans in 1319; his son, who died 1352, was old enough to make a will
(Old White Book, f. 54).</p>

<p><a name='f_659' id='f_659' href='#fna_659'>[659]</a> Cf. Mon. Franc. II, pp. xxvi-xxvii. ‘An analysis of a considerable
number of wills ... from the Registers of the Norwich Consistory Court ...,
shows that at a time when the Grey Friars were falling out of favour,
every third will conveyed a gift to them.’ The wills proved in the court
of the Archdeacon of Oxford (now under the care of Mr. Rodman at Somerset
House) begin in 1529. Between 1529 and 1538 I found twenty-nine wills, in
which the town of Oxford, or some person or persons resident in Oxford,
are referred to; of these, thirteen contain bequests to friars, nine of
them containing bequests to the Grey Friars, either alone or (more
usually) in conjunction with other Orders. In the same register, out of
forty-three wills, taken at random from the years 1529-30, 1534-5, five
only contained bequests to friars, three of them mentioning the Minorites.</p>

Leland states on the evidence of the <i>Catalogus de eruditis Franciscanis</i>,
which he had seen in the Minorite convent at Oxford, that Adam wrote ‘a
fair number of commentaries on Holy Scripture.’ One edition of Barth. of
Pisa (Bononiae, 1620) mentions as his works, Elucidarium Scripturae, and
Theological Lectures. This passage is not in the edition of 1510. It is
not probable that the ‘Ordinances for the household of Bishop Grostete,’

<p><a name='f_950' id='f_950' href='#fna_950'>[950]</a> The good effects of Eustace’s conversion were commented on by
‘Peter, minister of England,’ 1251-1256 (Mon. Franc. I, 40). But Eustace
entered the Order during the ministry of W. of Nottingham. Two of the
letters (Nos. 178 and 200) in which Adam Marsh mentions Eustace as a friar
are addressed to ‘Friar W., minister of England,’ but several of these
superscriptions are undoubtedly wrong and the rest consequently of little
value. Letter 179, however, written at the same time as 178 and stating
Eustace’s refusal to lecture at Norwich, is addressed to Robert of
Thornham, who was then evidently custodian of Cambridge (Mon. Franc. I,
62). In a letter to W. of Nottingham (No. 173) Adam states that this
Robert was just starting for the Holy Land, and as he certainly went (Mon.
Franc. I, 62), there is no reason to suppose that he delayed long. What
then is the date of letter 173? That the superscription is correct is
shown by the mention in the letter of Peter, minister of Cologne, i.e. P.
of Tewkesbury, William’s successor in England; Adam also mentions his
regret at being unable to accompany Grostete to the Roman court owing to
his having to assist the Archbishop of Canterbury. These details fix the
date of Robert’s departure (or resolution to depart) to Palestine at 1250:
thus letter 179 cannot have been written later than 1250, and Eustace must
have entered the Order in that year at latest. He witnesses a charter as
friar in 1251; Wood, MS. D 2, p. 537.</p>

made Minister of England in the same Chapter in which Albert was elected
General, that he ‘ministered one year in England, and was afterwards
elected General’ (ibid. 57, 59). There is no reason to suppose that Haymo
resigned the Provincialate before he became General. The early dates in
the Registrum are untrustworthy. Further, a note to the Phillipps MS. of
Eccleston (fol. 76, <i>dorse</i>) says, in a list of General Ministers:
‘quintus fuit frater Albertus de Pysis bonus et sanctus homo qui non vixit
in ministerio nisi sex mensibus et migravit ad dominum.’ The handwriting

tradition founded on a foolish legend. Historical fictions die hard. In
1889, Mr. W. L. Courtney writes in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, Vol. XLVI, p.
255, R. Bacon ‘seems to have been educated at Brasenose College in Oxford,
although Merton College has also laid claim to the honour of his youthful
learning.’ Merton College was not founded till Roger was advanced in
years; Brasenose College was founded more than two centuries after his
death.</p>

where the historian says that he was supplied with details for the life of
St. Edmund by <i>Robert</i> Bacon. The confusion between the two Bacons is
continually recurring. Even in Luard’s edition of Grostete’s Letters there
is an unfortunate misprint; on p. 65 Roger Bacon should be Robert.</p>

this have been Roger Bacon? That his name should be suppressed is not to
be wondered at. (The Reg. of Friars Minors at London adds after the name
of John of Parma, General Minister, 1247-1256: ‘Hic etiam scripsit fratri

Jebb reasonably calls the accuracy of this statement in question, Op.

‘not a doctor of the 13th or 14th century,’ says Charles, p. 42, ‘quotes
Bacon; not one combats or approves his opinions.’ In an anonymous
treatise, <i>De recuperatione sanctae Terrae</i>, addressed to Edward III, c.
1370, the author recommends the study of mathematics, ‘propter plures
earum utilitates, praecipue tactas in libello super utilitatibus hujusmodi
confecto per fratrem Rogerum Bacon de ordine Minorum;’ printed in Bongars,

‘curious book,’ <i>De retardatione senectutis</i>, Brown, Fasc. Rerum, Vol. I,

date from the middle of the 15th century. Barth. of Pisa however says:

Parisiensi.’</p>

<p><a name='f_1424' id='f_1424' href='#fna_1424'>[1424]</a> He says, e.g. on the authority of the letter, that Duns was at

Tract ii’ (the only portion of Part III known to him), <i>Tractatus
tertius</i>. Thus fol. 98 b: ‘Tractatus tertius est de viribus Romani imperii
et habet 5 libros.’ Books 1, 2, and 3, correspond to those printed in
Goldast (Pars III, Tract. ii, Libri 1, 2, 3): Book 4 discussed whether the
emperor should defend the rights of the Roman Empire by arms ‘etiam contra
papam cardinales et clerum’; Book 5 treated ‘de rebellibus, proditoribus,
... Romani imperii.’ These two books were not known to Peter d’Ailly, and

faithful favorer,’ who was employed in negotiating with the University of
Bologna for a decision favourable to the divorce (1530): Cal. of State
Papers, Vol. IV, No. 6619. But there was another Friar Nicholas at this
time who was employed by the Pope, Wolsey, Henry VIII, and other princes.
This was a German Dominican, Nicholas de Scombergt or Schomberg, usually
called Friar Nicholas or Fra Niccolo. He came to England in 1517, the same
year that N. de Burgo began to teach in Oxford. He was in England in 1526,
and hoped to be made cardinal. In Oct. 1532 he was on his way to Capua
(from England?): a few months previously, Dr. Nicholas of Oxford (i.e.
probably N. de Burgo) was trying to leave England. These facts are taken
from the Calendars of State Papers, Hen. VIII. Vols. II-V.</p>
